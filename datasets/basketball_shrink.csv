Is it unusual that after i gained 50lbs in 5 months i somehow became more athletic,"The change in my athleticism has been insane, i can run faster,jump higher and just feel more comfortable in my body overall as i feel like i have better mobility and overall feel better at 230lbs than i did at 175. Before the weight gain i couldnt dunk despite standing at 6'5'' and couldnt even touch the rim (yeah it was that bad) but now i can do dunks that i thought were impossible before. I was also amongst the slowest players in the team and was mostly just another spot up shooter due to being incredibly slow but now i came in second at the 40yd dash at 4.46. So what im wondering is, did my weight really help with my athleticism or did i just grow into my body better over these 5 months?",0.97,98,98,63,Basketball

Please help with the noise of my basketball practice,"I'm 16 (6ft) and have lost 20kg doing basketball drills and bodyweight plyometics in my back garden. (3 months now)

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

What can I do to reduce the noise?
I was thinking of removing the grass in my backyard and build a basketball court. (As i only have a 2mx10m space to play. 6ft6x10ft)
Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

I've been saving up for a backyard court for 6 months now and in another 6 I'll be able to afford it.

Untill then and after then what can I do to reduce the noise?

I keep bruising my big toe nail; question about shoe size,"I’ve started a basketball league after playing a few months of pick up. My right big toe is severely bruised and painful from hitting the front of my shoes. Everything online says I need tighter shoes to slide less but my right foot is actually half a size bigger than my left so I feel like it may need to be larger? Unless the effect is due to my right foot being dominate?

Anyways, how tight should basketball shoes be at the toe?",1.0,2,2,3,Basketball

So I just started like officially liking basketball :D,"Ok so I know what you're thinking.

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" 🤷‍♂️ 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

So after binging secret base videos, doing some research on the organization as well as watching the team get a 2nd victory over the pacers in the playoffs, I became a Miami Heat Fan.

How to increase your vertical (The way I did),"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.

* 1: You can't just do a million calf raises

I watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.

*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire body

The few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.

* 3: Learn the proper form

If you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.

* 4: Start Low with a small ball

Now not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball

* 5: Dunk every day

This tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!

These 5 super simple steps take a lot of hard work, but helped increase my vertical over 8 inches. If you want any personal advice please private message me and ill give you whatever knowledge i have!",1.0,3,3,4,Basketball

Questions on getting signed NBA memorabilia as a gift,"Hi,

I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:

* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? 

Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?

And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? 

* Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?

Guaranteed Way To Become Harder To The Court," 

Creating space is a major key to becoming harder to guard on the court. The best players int he world can create space whether it's for a jumpshot, or a layup.

So what's the best way to create space??

Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!

You can do a sidestep, stepback, fadeway, whatever you need to get your shot off. The point remains the same. Attack &amp; React!",0.76,2,2,0,Basketball

I feel like I am losing brain cells during this argument and losing knowledge about basketball, I know this guy is a casual though because he says Lebron should've won DPOY and is still a better defender than AD. This guy is hurting me from how bad his takes are. so I just wanted to ask if there's legitly anyone else who believes Bam is a better defender than AD, or if there is a legitimate argument between their defense, because to me, theres no comparison between the 2 players.

Need a Strategy to help beat my Friends in a fullcourt 2v2,"My friends and I are starting to play full-court 2v2s for fun. We lost this one, but I want to win the next one by making a strategy to beat them.

Me - 5'10 - Can heat up and shoot from anywhere, also got a bit of a handle to beat defenders off the dribble with but not that physical.

My teammate - 5'9 - Big but not fast, can get a rebound and put it back up. Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.

Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.

&amp;#x200B;

We lost our first match up today by 3 points. I had some good moments but I didn't play well overall, losing my shooting rhythm after a couple of misses on a bad park rim. Tried to run pick and roll with my teammate, but Opponent #1 gave me trouble and ended up costing us two turnovers near the end of the game. I can get a shot over him in an iso, and I haven't really tried to drive on him since he's pretty athletic. I can't really drive past any of them since big guy cant shoot and the paint is clogged. All of this would be solved if I didn't lose my hot hand, and they would be forced to play up leaving the paint open for my teammate. I was thinking of getting my teammate to be guarded by opponent #2 to try to get a post shot off, but then again opponent#2 is pretty physical. Anyone know what I should do?",1.0,1,1,2,Basketball

More athletic?,"Hey everyone, 
I'm  5'10-11/ 178-9cm 
15 years old 
And if it matters (hopefully not) Asian

So for the past 4months since April, I haven't got the chance to get back on the court. Hence, I decided to work on my athletism, running faster jumping higher etc.

My standing vert has increased by at least 4-6 inches and is at 27inches now. Same with my running vert at 32 inches. I didn't do any test on my running speed. 

My question is, how much more can I improve? 

Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.
Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.

Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new. 

Also any good cardio exercises that I can do indoors? And what exercise did u do that really pushed ur athletism to the next level?

Advice for young players,"Looking back at my basketball career as I'm going to college, the highest level I played was Varsity and even on that team I wasn't very good. So my biggest advice to young players is to play more. It may not be the smartest idea right now during quarantine so make sure you stay safe.

Anyway, at my HS I was very introverted so didn't have a lot of friends that played b-ball but I loved it and practiced a lot by myself. Shooting drills, handling drills, analyzing pro games. I was trying everything to make myself improve BY MYSELF. And that was the greatest problem, there's only so much you can do by yourself.

You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.

The only time I played with others was during team practices and games. The people on my team were constantly playing every weekend with friends.

So this is my greatest advice. Play pickup or something. And most importantly, make sure you have fun. I'm gonna be honest, I hated practicing by myself because it was boring and exhausting and repetitive and frustrating. Not very fun. Playing with friends will be great.",1.0,111,111,9,Basketball

Fouls while driving/defending drives,"Hey, I'm a bit of a beginner regarding rules and I mostly play street with some friends. I would like some clarifications regarding a rule since I can't find it anywhere on Google: 

1So when I play defense, I mostly play man to man. And when my opponent starts to drive, i tend to end up in a shoulder to shoulder (side to side) sort of contact with them, where I'm on the inside (in relationship to the hoop). There's no other contact initiated by my part (no hand/forearm) just shoulder to shoulder. Is that considered a foul?

Inconsistent shooter that could use some advice,"My strength is in my drives, but every time i play 1v1 I am not able to use them. People just take so much distance from me they force me to shoot. I am an inconsistent shooter however.

How do I fix my release," So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it. 
 So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand. 

 I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:

1. I'm too weak

2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball

3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens

4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or hand

There's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.
I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release. 
 Oh, also, if any of you have any tips for my guide hand, then please tell me!

Hi all (I hope this is not a generic question).,"But I used to play a decent amount of basketball (around 2.5 hours training per day) for around 3 months, and my humoshot improved and so did my stamina.  However, my actual movement at the time was quite clunky/robotic apparently. So now I wanna get back into basketball, so I was wondering how can I make my moves more fluid and natural. Btw I have already done some flexibility/strength/stamina stuff in the last month. Also the moves I wanna concentrate on are stepback, crossover, sidestep, drive, and maybe fade away. Any tips would be appreciated. Also I would prefer to practice without a ball for now.",0.94,13,13,10,Basketball

Weight Lift Plan,"Hey guys!
I am from Germany and 21 years old. 
I‘ve been going to the Gym for about 5 years but i only did „normal“ weight lifting. 

This season i decided to work more on my game to become a starter (currently i am the 6th/7th man). 
Does anyone know some videos, people who shared a basketball specific workout plan?

I don‘t want to do casual weight lifting anymore. I want to do basketball related excerises that improve my strength, stamina, stability and atlethics.

It's really making it hard for me to watch. The refs made some controversial and downright wrong foul calls late in the games today (bucks/heat game 2 and game 7 rockets/thunder) , but I think it's largely from an endless barrage of criticism from players and coaches that they receive that makes their job even harder.

"Question: how to defend 1-on-1 post moves, specifically hook shot and fadeaway","The other day I was playing 1-on-1 with a friend who is of similar height, strength and speed.  Given that there's no shot clock, whichever one of us is on offense has been consistently able to get to the post via driving, then backing down the defender.  Once the offense is close enough (around the second hash mark in the paint), he initiates a series of back-to-the-basket post moves that usually ends in a hook shot or fadeaway jumper.

On defense, neither of us have been able to block or affect the shot of the fadeaway / hook shot, so the point pretty much comes down to whether the shooter misses or not.

Ideally as the defender, I would like to prevent the offense from getting so close to the basket, but it's very difficult because the offense can always make progress and back his way closer to the basket, but as the defender I can't really legally push him away from the basket.  Also, if I really try to apply a strong force, I risk the offense using my momentum against me to do a baseline spin for the easy layup.

Anyone have any ideas how to check the fadeaway / hook shots? Or is this why professional NBA players have dribble limits when they play 1:1, because otherwise it would be too easy for the offense?",1.0,1,1,5,Basketball

Poem for the game I love,"A poem i composed about my love for Basketball.

I walk into the court full of lights,

The fans on their feet all buzzing with joy,

My family waving with smiles,

I'm glad they've seen who I've become.

The ball is passed to me &amp; i dribble onward,

A screen to the left &amp; I shoot,

A 3 pointer &amp; i'm now in the zone,

We jostle back &amp; forth with many points scored,

A bit of fouls &amp; timeouts used,

The game moves on.

I look around &amp; see my teammates  I've played with,

I'm glad they accepted me &amp; encouraged me to be better,

With endless days of sweating &amp; training,

we are proud of we've become &amp; now bonded by ball,

with trust &amp; love, we move on as family &amp; as one we ball.

Dunks &amp; shots fill the court,

layups &amp; 3's scores the point,

a pass to my mate &amp; the clock tic tocks,

with head up high the court is scanned,

I'm free, he passes &amp; this is it,

scared of ending the game is who i am,

With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,

 A 3 point shot &amp; the game we win.

With smile &amp; joy we celebrate our win,

Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.

I open my eyes with a smile &amp; realize it's all dream,

In order to achieve my dreams I need to train some more,

Stopping the sound of the ball?,"I always played a bit of basketball when I was younger (for school teams and just general messing around). However I only recently got my own net for my back garden.

I have stayed true to this but every time I take a shot the bounce still sounds quite loud. I tried rebounding all my shots before the bounce but that obviously didn't work very well.

There is also sometimes the problem of a stray bounce off the rim that goes towards my window. 

I was looking at returners but it seems the only affordable ones are the ones that collect made shots only. I was wondering if anyone knew of any affordable ones that collected missed shots? Would also be open to other suggestions to solve the noise problem.

Creating for myself and attacking the basket,"I only play pickup really but I need the basics of this shit broken down for me. I’m pretty embarrassed to be in my 20s and asking this but fuck it.

My main skill is shooting and I feel super confident about it but everyone knows or can tell once they start playing with me. I can typically extend my range a few steps behind the 3 point line too but if a guy just stands in front of me and I have the ball I freeze. I can do just about everything else fine on the court but this, especially when my shots not dropping and my confidence is low I’ll literally just force a shot over my defender or pass it back. I have been practicing a strong dribble and pull-up but need much better ball handling in order to even take 2 strong dribbles.

I’m also not that fast with the ball which hurts my confidence, but even my friends who aren’t that fast can get it done too so I know it’s not that big of a deal

Why do lots of NBA players jump before shooting?,"My best guess is that by jumping before shooting they can focus more on the horizontal distance the ball travels rather than how high it goes, but surely it's more beneficial to combine arms with legs? 

There are many players who do this, so it would make more sense to give examples of those who don't, like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard.

As for me, I prefer to shoot while jumping as opposed to after jumping, as I always seem to undershoot when I  do the latter. I feel like shooting midair just introduces another variable to keep track of, and I often lose balance (or maybe I'm just not athletic enough to pull shots like that off). Maybe height matters?

Contrary to that, maybe my form is a bit off, so I would be accepting of any tips for shooting midair (since I am quite short and shooting over defenders would be beneficial)

"As a Basketball Fan, This Sucks","Wanted to share a short piece I wrote.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. For myself, and so many others, watching NBA basketball has always been a way to escape. A way to escape the adversity and hardships in our daily life, and the inherent pain and suffering that we all experience as human beings. The NBA allowed me to dream like a kid again, to dream of my childhood team winning a championship, to dream that I could soar like Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But, my favorite thing about the NBA and sports, is the way that it brings people together. People from all walks of life, united, regardless of color or religion, rooting for one purpose. The chance to win.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. In times like these, with the kind of year that *we all* have had, we needed sports. We needed an escape, now, more than ever. We desperately needed a reminder, of what it was like to hope, to believe, and to dream again. I wish that the NBA would continue on so that I could continue to escape reality and continue living in the comfort of my own bubble. But, that would be taking the easy way out. The reality is, we would never grow, evolve, or improve if we never left our comfort zones and turned a blind eye to issues that made us feel sad or uncomfortable.

So yes, as a basketball fan, this sucks. But this is bigger than basketball. Our country needs change, now, more than ever.

Mens Basketball leagues starting up again?,So I graduated from college this past spring and played a ton of pick up ball during my four years. I enjoyed getting better and just trying my best to execute during games. This corona virus and quarantine has obviously sucked for a lot of people for a lot of reasons. I spent two months not balling when quarantine started and when the weather got warmer I started practicing again but felt like I was far from what I had been. I’ve recently play put doors with a consistent group for a few weeks but all these guys have started going back to college and I find myself alone again. It’s really starting to bum me out because most of my friends from school are doing a 5th year and I can’t visit them or play ball with them due to the university restrictions. I’ve just felt so sad lately. I keep practicing on my own but it is starting to feel hollow without getting to play with anyone. I just don’t know what to do. I was wondering if anyone knew of any mens leagues that may be trying to start up again so maybe I have some hope? Thanks and hope y’all are safe and healthy,1.0,2,2,0,Basketball

any NBA players can dunk if they wanted to.,"Not sure if this has been posted before but it’s been bothering me seeing a lot of people on here and other online posts saying certain NBA players (shorter) can’t dunk. However, I believe that every NBA player can dunk if they wanted to. People may try to make the argument that “Nate Robinson, IT, Spudd Webb could only dunk because they were super athletic”. However, they disregard the fact that to make the NBA at that height, it is imperative that they will be extremely athletic! A little background, I am on the shorter side (5’10) playing at the college level, and most guys my height (and shorter) have no problem dunking (even if off a lob). Not only at the college level are people below 6’ dunking, but even in high school. If high school kids are able to slam it with ease, wouldn’t it be obvious that an NBA player would be able to dunk? Therefore, with NBA training and athleticism, it is clear that every NBA player can dunk if they wished to.",0.5,0,0,5,Basketball

How do you become a better scorer (not just shooter)?,"I just play casually.

I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.

I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!

Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.

It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.

Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.

I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.

TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But in 5v5 my player defends the shot super close, and if I drive a help defender comes in and the paint is clogged. And there never seems to be enough space to work my defender off the dribble. I don't have any scoring moves or dribble moves, I just do basic stuff so maybe i need to improve that.",1.0,4,4,24,Basketball

4. Has greatest differences in intensity in different parts of games
5. Unorthodox rules (ex. Winner's ball etc

Waist pain,"Hello everyone 

It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. 

To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  
I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that? 

Any help or oppinion is greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much in advance.",1.0,1,1,4,Basketball

Youth Coaches: Stop Playing Only Zone Defense,"This is a message to youth coaches that want to try and help your kids grow as players. I coach Freshmen basketball, and one of the biggest hurdles I face each year is teaching kids how to play man-to-man defense. 

Within recent years, I’ve noticed that the majority of youth coaches exclusively teach zone defense, and kids usually aren’t taught the basics of man-to-man defense. Even my best players that travel all over and play AAU ball have no idea what a weak-side rotation looks like or how to guard a pick-n-roll outside of a switch.

I hear kids say things like “your man put up 20 points on you” without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they’re only responsibility is the player they’re assigned to.

"You are not a NBA player, stop shooting threes unless you are extremely efficient","I quit basketball 10 years ago due to various reasons. I starting playing again March and joined a recreational league last week. I am a pretty decent center 6'7 and my post moves are still pretty solid. However I cant dribble a ball to save my life. So I dont dribble, I pass, post moves get to the rim etc. I played in a recreational league before and I dont think I have ever shot a three in a serious match(I am a center but still)

But for the love of god and this annoys me so much: why does everyone think shooting threes is efficient. I havent seen anyone who averages above 25% in shooting drills so why the fuck do you think it is a good idea to shoot threes. They are the most wasteful shot in basketball unless you are an elite level player.

10 years ago seeing a three in recreational league was a rare thing, nowadays people just accept that guards can shoot threes if they  are open, it is so inefficient.",1.0,6,6,5,Basketball

Today I met a pro player at the court I practice at and he gave me a masterclass!,"So today I went to this little court I go to practice basketball (just to stay fit, and because I love the sport) (for clarification: I've never played more than high school level and have never practiced in a team, with a proper coach, routines etc. I always played with friends though, and tried to get it right and improve, but nothing serious. I started playing again in my 40's because it seemed a good way to stay fit and exercise outdoors)

So this dude comes around and starts shooting. I immediately see that he's very good. He starts nailing triple shots with perfect shooting form without any effort and I'm realizing the guy's a beast. So I go up and say hey, can I ask you for some advice?

I didn't want to interfere with his routine or training, I was just looking for a quick tip.

But the dude immediately drops everything and starts giving me a detailed explanation, asking me to follow his moves, do this, look at that. Correcting me, encouraging me, explaining again. Checking if I followed instructions. He even pulls out his phone and records me twice and shows me in slow motion what was I doing correctly and what I was doing wrong.

With just a 3/4 tips, he has been able to change my shooting form completely, and now it feels so easy, so effective and effortless. I was able to balance the force used better, to focus on my aiming more, and my body just felt right throughout all the shooting move.

Turned out he is a pro basketball player, he plays 2nd national division in my country and is here on vacation lol. He made my day. He was so supportive and nice, even when we chatted for a while afterwards.

I probably thanked him 10 times, and still don't think it was enough. Soooo happy that this happened to me. Sometimes just asking for help goes a long way!",1.0,30,30,19,Basketball

Tips for a 20yo who has never touched a ball but wants to start playing?,"Hey!

Have I learned to shoot incorrectly?,"Hi, I'm 23 and relatively new to basketball in the sense that I have not played in games much (only shooting around for fun). For a long time I've practiced shooting with one hand, where my hand comes out to my side (an L shape) kind of like a hook shot but I am facing the ring with my body. I did this originally as I could generate a lot of power as I am using my shoulder to catapult the ball into the air. The release feels really satisfying and smooth, and it is more accurate than when I shoot with two hands from any point on the court. 

My question is, someone has told me that it isn't good to shoot like that and I do not know what to do. How do I make something else feel comfortable? and how do I make sure to not learn the wrong thing?

I want to get better at basketball as I really love it and its fun (even though I am not that good). I don't even know where to find a coach to try get better, and YouTube has so many different shooting methods that it confuses me. Sorry if this didn't make any sense.

Street Ball Rules for Making a Basket after calling a Foul,"Recently I was playing basketball with some friends. I drove to the basket and was fouled while taking a layup, thus prompting me to call the foul in the middle of my shot. The layup proceeded to fall and I just assumed the bucket would count and I’d get the ball back (we were playing 2v2 winners ball). However, the opposing team was adamant that me calling foul (even before I made or missed the shot) negated the points scored. This made absolutely no sense to me because then are you supposed to just never call foul in hopes of making the basket and not negating it? Additionally it takes more skill and finesse to finish through a foul so the points are especially earned. In every other form of basketball you’re allowed to get a foul call and still try and finish the bucket if you’re in the shooting motion. Why is street ball different?",1.0,1,1,4,Basketball
Steph doesn’t have the most range in the NBA,"Hear me out on this, Dame Lillard and Trae Young have better range than Steph Curry, although Steph is still the superior shooter, as he will remain the greatest shooter the game has ever seen for a long time.

Dame in 74 games this season made 56 30 footers on 43 percent shooting. It’s safe to say if it was a full season Dame would’ve made more 30 footers in one season on a higher percentage. Dame has the most range. As for Trae, he made 9 out of 16 shots from 35 feet and beyond, Steph made 9 out of 111. Trae just finished his second season.

Nervousness and Anxiety,"I’m 20 years old and I technically only started playing Basketball for 3 years. Up until recently I would ONLY do drill work and would be to nervous to play in actual games whether it be 5 on 5, 3 on 3, 2 on 2, etc. Right now I play as many games as I can.

Basketball back pain injury,"  

I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. 

However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.

I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. 

I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). 

After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.

I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. 

I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. 

The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. 

I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. 

Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. 

I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. 

I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. 

**Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here…** 

I'll end with this…

My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology. It taught me that things are ever-changing, and it is essential to go with the flow, accept your situation, and figure out how and what you can learn from it.

It is a offensive foul?,I was playing  full court pickup ball yesterday and there was a play where the guy defending me got hit in the chin and was on the ground in pain. My question is it a foul on the defender and an offensive foul? The defender who got hit was complaining it was a offensive foul and a couple people including myself said it was actually a foul on him.

We adapted a new rule at the court I play at.,"Instead of the classic old ""shoot for it"" or ""ball don't lie"" rule, we adapted a rule where if there is an argument or controversy,  each team takes turns getting the ball. If team x got the ball first, upon the first argument, team y would get it. What do you all think about this rule. Should it be adapted at all courts. I always absolutely hated the shoot for it rule. The BALL DOES LIE. And the rule is heavily favored for people that are good at shooting 3s. Often I see this rule abused. A good three point shooter will just start an argument about a call, then he'll shoot for it and likely make it. It's a win-win situation.  It just doesn't make sense how this street rule got started.",0.86,5,5,2,Basketball

PSA to all you young players out there. STOP WORRYING ABOUT VERT! I am. It saying don’t train your legs to be strong and to explode. But I promise promise promise you should know that vert is one of the easier things to get and one of the least important parts to a good player,"
Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  

Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6’6” and that doesn’t hurt but he isn’t jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  

I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you’ll gain vert. It’s that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time.

Standing Jump Higher than Running Jump,"Note: TL;DR at bottom

Hi everyone. Before I explain my issue, here’s some information about me:

Today, I got a basketball hoop after being without one for a couple years due to moving across the country. I’m in my late teens, and I’ve grown a lot since the last time I played basketball. I’m 6’4 now, and I decided I wanted to try learning how to dunk. 

I called one of my friends who regularly plays basketball and has been trying to dunk for a while now (he’s about 6’0.5). He told me to show him my standing jump, and I was able to touch the rim (10ft hoop), but not higher. He then told me to try getting a running start to increase my vert. I did, and I kept reaching a couple inches below the rim at my peak height. Can anyone give me some tips so I can gain some inches on my running jump instead of losing a couple of inches? Thanks.

TL;DR: 6’4. Just started trying to dunk. Can touch rim on 10ft hoop with standing jump. Can’t touch rum on running jump. Can anyone give me tips on how to go higher with running jump? Thanks.

Note: My hoop is on a slight incline of about 2-3 degrees so that might affect it, but that shouldn’t make my running jump lower than my standing right?",1.0,2,2,2,Basketball

I’m also a decent passer but my teammates are often not and throw passes that are super low and or slow and really don’t realize I’m well over 1/2 a foot taller than everyone else so they can just chuck the ball up to my arms.

Hey i want some advice for my position,"First of all i'm korean so plz understand me for my poor english skills

I'm 5'11 tall and my wingspan is similar to my height i'm pretty muscular so i played as a small forward or sometimes undersize Pf when i was in high school and i'm just a amateur not a pro

Recently i participated a basketball club where guys play just for fun 

The old members asked me about my position and i said i'm sf

Then they told me i'm a bit small for a sf( normally in korea pg-5'9 sg-5'11 sf-6'1 pf-6'3 C-6'5 and above for amateurs)

And they suggested me to play as a oversize pointguard or shooting guard cuz i have height advantage as a pg and i may have problem guarding opponent sf with my size

But the problem is i'm not a 3-point shooter. my favorite spot is elbow or 0-15feet midrange shots and drive in finished with layups

And i'm 25 yrs old so i don't think i can learn to play as a guard since i played most of the games as a forward

Let’s discuss.,"Anthony Davis.
Over-rated.
Don’t get me wrong.
Hear me out.
Individually, he is great and his stats state that.
Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.
Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn’t be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn’t embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that’s like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus. So, the credit is due and he is yet to earn his due. #Facts",0.81,3,3,1,Basketball

I'm amazed on how different (and in many ways, better) basketball was in general. Even the broadcast and image were a surprise, it had a certain glare, and the crowd, soundtrack, and the overall scheme was so surprising, it was a beauty to look at, visually, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen, it's stunning. 5 hours later, I'm watching a Rockets x Bucks game and I can't help but feel that ""it's great but not the same thing"" feel in the back of my head (the absence of a crowd doesn't help a bit).

NBA League Pass issue,"I usually watch the games the next day because I live in Europe. I also hide the scores in the apps settings but now after a while I've started to notice when a game goes to overtime (or doesn't).

On the other side, when the length of the video is around 90-100 minutes then you know the game ended in the regular time. Even though in the end I don't know who won the game, it takes the excitement out of the game in the end when you know if it does/doesn't go to overtime.

How do I develop a healthy relationship with basketball?,"At this point, I've really accepted that I'm addicted. Basketball and just working out in general have been my escape from everything, from the demands of life. It's the only place that I feel healthy tbh. Basketball's the only place where I've made friends that are real friends who I could really connect with. It's the only tim I felt like I'm alive and my life feels awesome cause of it. Sure, the road is full of challenges. Sure, I don't have the talent to make it to that level I always fantasize about. But basketball's something that reminds me that not everything is full of shit. It's that one thing, that constant challenge that helps fill this emptiness inside of me. 







But I gotta come clean today. If I had control over my life like that, maybe I'd be able to have a healthier relationship. But sometimes you don't and you feel that craving. ""It was supposed to be this way but it wasn't that way and you can't do anything about it."" If I got to hoop during all those missed opportunities, maybe life would be different. But I always get that reminder everyday that my life is _not_ about basketball and it constantly gets me to ask ""why?"" I always daydream about what it would be like if I were some hotshot in the league living the good life. 







I always get that reminder everyday that I'm not good enough. I play like it sometimes. I look good sometimes. But I'm barely good enough to even make varsity. I could, but with all this covid bullshit, maybe not this time. Some of it's on me. Mentally, my game is not always in the right place, and the reality is I suck. I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. 







It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play. Unfortunately, it's always gotta be that stuff I can't control getting in the way. And that's what really does make me upset and addicted.







Sorry I wasted everyone's time here. I really needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it's the fact that life's returning to normal over here. More school, more house chores, more family, and less basketball. I felt it. I felt it in quarantine, myself getting better. But today, I lost it. I lost all the confidence I had built up for months. I just don't feel the same anymore, and maybe it's because I wanna go back to the days of working out 2-3 times a day instead of once. You just feel your goals, your dreams in your grasp a bit, mayne not the NBA dream but the promise of freedom and a good life, then it slips away and goes farther than it was the last time.",0.77,9,9,10,Basketball

"6'6, hoping to increase vertical, build explosiveness, and utilize my height","I played basketball as a kid growing up but stopped in middle school as I had focused on other sports. However, I've been hoping to get back into it and I am realizing that despite being 6'6 I have virtually no vertical (can grab rim but that's it) and lack the power and explosiveness to really improve my game. Also, since the last time I played basketball I was like 12 years old and I never learned how to properly utilize my height. 

Some background: 20M, 6'6 and about 180 pounds which is pretty skinny. I consider myself ""in shape"" because I am a runner usually doing 45-90 minute runs at a decent pace, however this type of fitness is not helping me with my vertical or overall explosiveness. Most of my runs are aerobic but I occasionally do some faster paced anaerobic training.

I have heard that losing weight is helpful for improving vertical but due to running I don't have much weight to lose in the first place. My current plan includes increasing my calorie intake so I am actually gaining weight, as well as bodyweight workouts like jump squats and box jumps. I'm also hoping to spent time reading and watching videos about big man and power forward roles, as well. I want to focus more on ""quick twitch"" muscle development because right now my exercise is ""slow"" muscle work and endurance training.

Are there some other things I should focus on or think about as I begin trying to improve my game? Any general advice about getting back into basketball would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!",1.0,3,3,3,Basketball

I’m in NYC so we’re the best we’ve been since March(so people are back outside again), but I can’t imagine  people wearing masks in the hot sun plus when they’re playing intense game. And I’m Lowkey afraid to get into games with randoms because I don’t know where they’ve been, so I’m going with friends. The main conflict though is that playing a normal game while following guidelines is kinda impossible unless you play no defense and stay fully seperated on offense.

Any advice? Thanks!",1.0,3,3,5,Basketball

 I measured the hoop and it was definitely 10 feet and I’ve always practiced on this hoop. However it is outdoors and the floor is now slippy as my shoes I use for outdoors have lost there grip. My indoor courts are re-opening in about a week and I was wondering will this help with my jump.

If I line it up as a split finger shot the rotation is straighter, but should I change my shot just so the rotation looks better? Or should I keep it as is even with a clunky rotation?

Need help finding a team to cheer for,"Hey all, first time posting here as I’m just looking to spark my love of basketball again for the first time in decades since I miss sports so much. 

Grew up in the late 80s - early 90s and was already a big Chicago Bears fan for football, so cheering for the bulls was a no brainer with how exciting their lineup was. 

After the team went their own ways, I kind of lost interest in ball and started following other sports more closely and only know what I know about basketball from big news in the game and playing 2k casually. 

I’m a die hard Chicago Bears and Washington Capitals fan in football and hockey; which are the two sports I follow the most closely in other sports so I don’t have a default city to cheer for. 

Just looking for a team that has some exciting players, is overall good; but not a shoe in to win since I don’t want to be a bandwagon fan. Obviously since I’m a Bears fan, I don’t mind some disappointment in my sports cheering.

scarecrow), but when ball handler tries to get past me I bend my arms so that my upper arms are   
against my torso and my forearms are at a 90 degree angle but the arms are within my cylinder,   
so the offensive presses into my arm while I shuffle with them, they try to knock down my   
forearm but it always there in the same position, is this legal?

Q2- During defense when the ball handler has either his back ro me or is at 90 degree angle at me          
(where his shoulder faces me) is it legal to keep a hand on him, no force is applied just a soft touch   
so I know he's there while I scan the court.

Q3- Within the D, and the offenseive player recieves the ball, is it a foul if they use their shouler to   
push me back, like a shoulder hit thats like a punch and either I take a step back and no longer

Playing with a long term finger injury,"About 15 years ago I broke my pinky playing basketball, but due to my own ignorance and the lack of proper PT it never healed properly, therefore I have what's called a swan-neck deformity (Google at your own risk) on that finger. I'm wearing something called oval-8 on my day-to-day life to prevent it from hyper-extending and to prevent any further injury (accidentally banging the finger on anything can hurt like a mofo...), but for basketball I've just been taping it the adjacent finger (with the oval-8 underneath, just in case). Now the problem is that I've been trying to improve my handles but having the finger taped is unfortunately limiting me quite a lot.

tips to get better at slashing?,"I'm 16 years old, 6'1"" and I've been playing basketball for the past 2.5 years. I started playing late cause I was into soccer until I was 14(I'm European and soccer is more famous here, but I was quite short as well,til' I hit a 8 inch growth spurt aged 12-14 and went from 5'2 to 5'10 when I was in 7th grade. Now I'm 6'1 at 16 and I'm the 6 man on my varsity team at school just because of my slashing ability. I simply cannot drive past anyone, although my handles are pretty good. I just pull up around mid range or shoot floaters even when I'm on a 1 on 1 fast break. I rely on my shooting ability unless I have a wide open lay-up in which I stop dribbling right under the basket and bank it in and not do that while I'm driving. Even against smaller and shorter opponents I can't drive past them because I don't know when to pick up my dribble and not travel(for eurostep or a hopstep for example), so I just post up and shoot a hook or a fade away. If it somehow helps, I can even dunk. Do you have any tips to get better at driving towards the basket when an opponent is there?   


PS I'm a PF-C (height averages on high school basketball are much lower in Europe hence my position when I'm 6'1"", simply because it isn't a big thing like it is in the USA and kids usually don't play to not risk getting injured, mens' team academies basketball like under 18, under 16 squads etc is much bigger plus you have an actual chance of playing professional or semi-pro basketball when you're 16+.

I was finally able to get my hands on a solid portable hoop (the silverback nxt 54) which has sufficiently met my expectations, and then some. It's far and away the best portable hoop I've ever used. However, there is just one design omission that some other slightly more expensive hoops have (the spalding ultimate hybrid)... which is a ""base rebounder"" --- something that I am finding would be extremely useful. My hoop has two unprotected arms stemming out from the main pole to the front of the base assembly. For the most part not a HUGE problem, except when I'm practicing free throws. When you're swishing those suckers one after the other, it's frustrating that each time you hit one the ball careens off in every conceivable direction... essentially a middle finger to me for hitting each shot.
