,Basketball,"I'm 16 (6ft) and have lost 20kg doing basketball drills and bodyweight plyometics in my back garden. (3 months now)

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

What can I do to reduce the noise?
I was thinking of removing the grass in my backyard and build a basketball court. (As i only have a 2mx10m space to play. 6ft6x10ft)
Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

I've been saving up for a backyard court for 6 months now and in another 6 I'll be able to afford it.

Untill then and after then what can I do to reduce the noise?

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" 🤷‍♂️ 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

,Basketball,"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.

* 1: You can't just do a million calf raises

I watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.

*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire body

The few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.

* 3: Learn the proper form

If you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.

* 4: Start Low with a small ball

Now not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball

* 5: Dunk every day

This tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!

,Basketball,"Hi,

I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:

* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? 

Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?

And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? 

* Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?

So what's the best way to create space??

Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!

&lt;p&gt;Pick a shoulder &amp;amp; attack your opponent hard &amp;amp; make him BELIEVE you&amp;#39;re going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!&lt;/p&gt;

Me - 5'10 - Can heat up and shoot from anywhere, also got a bit of a handle to beat defenders off the dribble with but not that physical.

My teammate - 5'9 - Big but not fast, can get a rebound and put it back up. Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.

Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.

Tried to run pick and roll with my teammate, but Opponent #1 gave me trouble and ended up costing us two turnovers near the end of the game. I can get a shot over him in an iso, and I haven't really tried to drive on him since he's pretty athletic. I can't really drive past any of them since big guy cant shoot and the paint is clogged. All of this would be solved if I didn't lose my hot hand, and they would be forced to play up leaving the paint open for my teammate.

I was thinking of getting my teammate to be guarded by opponent #2 to try to get a post shot off, but then again opponent#2 is pretty physical. Anyone know what I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"Hey everyone, 
I'm  5'10-11/ 178-9cm 
15 years old 
And if it matters (hopefully not) Asian

So for the past 4months since April, I haven't got the chance to get back on the court. Hence, I decided to work on my athletism, running faster jumping higher etc.

My standing vert has increased by at least 4-6 inches and is at 27inches now. Same with my running vert at 32 inches. I didn't do any test on my running speed. 

My question is, how much more can I improve? 

Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.
Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.

Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new. 

Also any good cardio exercises that I can do indoors? And what exercise did u do that really pushed ur athletism to the next level?

,Basketball,"Looking back at my basketball career as I'm going to college, the highest level I played was Varsity and even on that team I wasn't very good. So my biggest advice to young players is to play more. It may not be the smartest idea right now during quarantine so make sure you stay safe.

Anyway, at my HS I was very introverted so didn't have a lot of friends that played b-ball but I loved it and practiced a lot by myself. Shooting drills, handling drills, analyzing pro games. I was trying everything to make myself improve BY MYSELF. And that was the greatest problem, there's only so much you can do by yourself.

You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.

The only time I played with others was during team practices and games. The people on my team were constantly playing every weekend with friends.

So this is my greatest advice. Play pickup or something. And most importantly, make sure you have fun. I'm gonna be honest, I hated practicing by myself because it was boring and exhausting and repetitive and frustrating. Not very fun.

,Basketball,"Hey, I'm a bit of a beginner regarding rules and I mostly play street with some friends. I would like some clarifications regarding a rule since I can't find it anywhere on Google: 

1So when I play defense, I mostly play man to man.

I also play rather “robotic” and not really shifty.This year, I’m gonna work hard on not only my game but my fitness as well. I was wondering how long it took for you guys to stop being scared in games, and how to become less robotic in games?&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball," So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it. 
 So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand. 

 I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:

1. I'm too weak

2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball

3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens

4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or hand

There's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.
I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release. 
 Oh, also, if any of you have any tips for my guide hand, then please tell me!

Last month I attended a couple of basketball tournament, and I've found that I can't translate my skills in real games when playing against defenders on me.

This has made me start doubting myself if I should not spend hours practice those drills alone and also made me start losing confidence recently because I feel like all those hours and grinds I've spent are not showing...The worst part is that I know my skills are better than many people out there but I am less useful when it comes to real games.

I got into basketball recently and I'd love to get a book with plenty of images (preferably photos but illustrations are cool too).

I am not interested on the history of the sport or biographies of players. I am looking for a book that shows the essential moves, gives advices on exercises to improve, etc. 

I would particularly love player movements broken down in sequential images.

I searched on the internet and found something that is close, it is titled basketball anatomy, the illustrations shows key muscle groups and stuff, but it is more focused on strength training for basketball players. So it looks not bad, bad too niche.

I wonder if basketball for dummies would fit my expectations.

,Basketball,"A poem i composed about my love for Basketball.

I walk into the court full of lights,

The fans on their feet all buzzing with joy,

My family waving with smiles,

I'm glad they've seen who I've become.

The ball is passed to me &amp; i dribble onward,

A screen to the left &amp; I shoot,

A 3 pointer &amp; i'm now in the zone,

We jostle back &amp; forth with many points scored,

A bit of fouls &amp; timeouts used,

The game moves on.

I look around &amp; see my teammates  I've played with,

I'm glad they accepted me &amp; encouraged me to be better,

With endless days of sweating &amp; training,

we are proud of we've become &amp; now bonded by ball,

with trust &amp; love, we move on as family &amp; as one we ball.

Dunks &amp; shots fill the court,

layups &amp; 3's scores the point,

a pass to my mate &amp; the clock tic tocks,

with head up high the court is scanned,

I'm free, he passes &amp; this is it,

scared of ending the game is who i am,

With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,

 A 3 point shot &amp; the game we win.

With smile &amp; joy we celebrate our win,

Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.

I open my eyes with a smile &amp; realize it's all dream,

,Basketball,"Wanted to share a short piece I wrote.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. For myself, and so many others, watching NBA basketball has always been a way to escape. A way to escape the adversity and hardships in our daily life, and the inherent pain and suffering that we all experience as human beings. The NBA allowed me to dream like a kid again, to dream of my childhood team winning a championship, to dream that I could soar like Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But, my favorite thing about the NBA and sports, is the way that it brings people together. People from all walks of life, united, regardless of color or religion, rooting for one purpose. The chance to win.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. In times like these, with the kind of year that *we all* have had, we needed sports. We needed an escape, now, more than ever. We desperately needed a reminder, of what it was like to hope, to believe, and to dream again. I wish that the NBA would continue on so that I could continue to escape reality and continue living in the comfort of my own bubble. But, that would be taking the easy way out. The reality is, we would never grow, evolve, or improve if we never left our comfort zones and turned a blind eye to issues that made us feel sad or uncomfortable.

So yes, as a basketball fan, this sucks. But this is bigger than basketball. Our country needs change, now, more than ever.

 I scored 0 points the whole season.
Not a single free throw or anything.

The season changed me so much, i just couldnt. I felt like telling my coach that im gonna quit the team. That season just embarrased me so much and i cringe every time i think of it.

,Basketball,"I just play casually.

I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.

I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!

Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.

It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.

Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.

I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.

TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But in 5v5 my player defends the shot super close, and if I drive a help defender comes in and the paint is clogged. And there never seems to be enough space to work my defender off the dribble.

,Basketball,"Hello everyone 

It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. 

To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  
I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that?

I hear kids say things like “your man put up 20 points on you” without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they’re only responsibility is the player they’re assigned to.

Or just make mistake after mistake and drop it,i&amp;#39;m not even the most social guy so being in squad with other people might result kinda hard at the start....? I&amp;#39;m not like fat,obese or anything, i go to the gym i sweat, i try to train hard, but i don&amp;#39;t know if lifting weight can be compared to playing a sport as a team...&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"So today I went to this little court I go to practice basketball (just to stay fit, and because I love the sport) (for clarification: I've never played more than high school level and have never practiced in a team, with a proper coach, routines etc. I always played with friends though, and tried to get it right and improve, but nothing serious. I started playing again in my 40's because it seemed a good way to stay fit and exercise outdoors)

So this dude comes around and starts shooting. I immediately see that he's very good. He starts nailing triple shots with perfect shooting form without any effort and I'm realizing the guy's a beast. So I go up and say hey, can I ask you for some advice?

I didn't want to interfere with his routine or training, I was just looking for a quick tip.

But the dude immediately drops everything and starts giving me a detailed explanation, asking me to follow his moves, do this, look at that. Correcting me, encouraging me, explaining again. Checking if I followed instructions. He even pulls out his phone and records me twice and shows me in slow motion what was I doing correctly and what I was doing wrong.

With just a 3/4 tips, he has been able to change my shooting form completely, and now it feels so easy, so effective and effortless. I was able to balance the force used better, to focus on my aiming more, and my body just felt right throughout all the shooting move.

Turned out he is a pro basketball player, he plays 2nd national division in my country and is here on vacation lol. He made my day. He was so supportive and nice, even when we chatted for a while afterwards.

,Basketball,"  

I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. 

However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.

I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. 

I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). 

After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.

I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. 

I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. 

The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. 

I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. 

Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. 

I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. 

I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. 

**Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here…** 

I'll end with this…

My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology. It taught me that things are ever-changing, and it is essential to go with the flow, accept your situation, and figure out how and what you can learn from it.

Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  

Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6’6” and that doesn’t hurt but he isn’t jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  

I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you’ll gain vert. It’s that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time.

Hi everyone. Before I explain my issue, here’s some information about me:

Today, I got a basketball hoop after being without one for a couple years due to moving across the country. I’m in my late teens, and I’ve grown a lot since the last time I played basketball. I’m 6’4 now, and I decided I wanted to try learning how to dunk. 

I called one of my friends who regularly plays basketball and has been trying to dunk for a while now (he’s about 6’0.5). He told me to show him my standing jump, and I was able to touch the rim (10ft hoop), but not higher. He then told me to try getting a running start to increase my vert. I did, and I kept reaching a couple inches below the rim at my peak height. Can anyone give me some tips so I can gain some inches on my running jump instead of losing a couple of inches? Thanks.

TL;DR: 6’4. Just started trying to dunk. Can touch rim on 10ft hoop with standing jump. Can’t touch rum on running jump. Can anyone give me tips on how to go higher with running jump? Thanks.

,Basketball,"First of all i'm korean so plz understand me for my poor english skills

I'm 5'11 tall and my wingspan is similar to my height i'm pretty muscular so i played as a small forward or sometimes undersize Pf when i was in high school and i'm just a amateur not a pro

Recently i participated a basketball club where guys play just for fun 

The old members asked me about my position and i said i'm sf

Then they told me i'm a bit small for a sf( normally in korea pg-5'9 sg-5'11 sf-6'1 pf-6'3 C-6'5 and above for amateurs)

And they suggested me to play as a oversize pointguard or shooting guard cuz i have height advantage as a pg and i may have problem guarding opponent sf with my size

But the problem is i'm not a 3-point shooter. my favorite spot is elbow or 0-15feet midrange shots and drive in finished with layups

And i'm 25 yrs old so i don't think i can learn to play as a guard since i played most of the games as a forward 

Do you think i should learn to play as a guard since i can have height and strength advantage? Or should i just keep playing as a forward cuz i'm used to it

Over-rated.
Don’t get me wrong.
Hear me out.
Individually, he is great and his stats state that.
Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.
Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn’t be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn’t embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that’s like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus.

So before the pandemic started, I wasn't that good at basketball. I was okay, but nowhere near my friend's level.

The past four days I haven't been able to practice because of a family emergency, and I just feel really down about it and I'm really pissed at myself for not playing ball or practicing.

Does anyone know ways to cope with this or have any workouts you can do at home?

,Basketball,"I've been watching basketball for years but never stopped to watch an entire game from the man himself (or any old/legendary game), and today I decided to do just that, a 55 point MJ one against the Knicks (Ewing was amazing too) and not only the game dynamic was different, it flowed a LOT better, as there were fewer pauses and fouls, there was more *game* in the game, and Michael's playing is out of this universe

I'm amazed on how different (and in many ways, better) basketball was in general. Even the broadcast and image were a surprise, it had a certain glare, and the crowd, soundtrack, and the overall scheme was so surprising, it was a beauty to look at, visually, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen, it's stunning. 5 hours later, I'm watching a Rockets x Bucks game and I can't help but feel that ""it's great but not the same thing"" feel in the back of my head (the absence of a crowd doesn't help a bit). 

I know we have the second best ever with LeBron today, but it's like something was lost with time, it doesn't get as ""grand"" as this old Bulls X Knicks game felt to me. Idk.

If you feel like it, recommend some legendary games for me to try and find through the internet to increase my knowledge of the greats before the 2000s",t2_3t0xl9gy,False,,0,False,Just watched my first Jordan game and I'm in awe,[],r/Basketball,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_i2p6ps,False,dark,0.94,,public,75,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},DISCUSSION,False,75,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1596451527.0,text,6,,,text,self.Basketball,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been watching basketball for years but never stopped to watch an entire game from the man himself (or any old/legendary game), and today I decided to do just that, a 55 point MJ one against the Knicks (Ewing was amazing too) and not only the game dynamic was different, it flowed a LOT better, as there were fewer pauses and fouls, there was more &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; in the game, and Michael&amp;#39;s playing is out of this universe&lt;/p&gt;

,Basketball,"At this point, I've really accepted that I'm addicted. Basketball and just working out in general have been my escape from everything, from the demands of life. It's the only place that I feel healthy tbh. Basketball's the only place where I've made friends that are real friends who I could really connect with. It's the only tim I felt like I'm alive and my life feels awesome cause of it. Sure, the road is full of challenges. Sure, I don't have the talent to make it to that level I always fantasize about. But basketball's something that reminds me that not everything is full of shit. It's that one thing, that constant challenge that helps fill this emptiness inside of me. 







But I gotta come clean today. If I had control over my life like that, maybe I'd be able to have a healthier relationship. But sometimes you don't and you feel that craving. ""It was supposed to be this way but it wasn't that way and you can't do anything about it."" If I got to hoop during all those missed opportunities, maybe life would be different. But I always get that reminder everyday that my life is _not_ about basketball and it constantly gets me to ask ""why?"" I always daydream about what it would be like if I were some hotshot in the league living the good life. 







I always get that reminder everyday that I'm not good enough. I play like it sometimes. I look good sometimes. But I'm barely good enough to even make varsity. I could, but with all this covid bullshit, maybe not this time. Some of it's on me. Mentally, my game is not always in the right place, and the reality is I suck. I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. 







It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play. Unfortunately, it's always gotta be that stuff I can't control getting in the way. And that's what really does make me upset and addicted.







Sorry I wasted everyone's time here. I really needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it's the fact that life's returning to normal over here. More school, more house chores, more family, and less basketball. I felt it. I felt it in quarantine, myself getting better. But today, I lost it. I lost all the confidence I had built up for months. I just don't feel the same anymore, and maybe it's because I wanna go back to the days of working out 2-3 times a day instead of once.

I consider myself ""in shape"" because I am a runner usually doing 45-90 minute runs at a decent pace, however this type of fitness is not helping me with my vertical or overall explosiveness. Most of my runs are aerobic but I occasionally do some faster paced anaerobic training.

I have heard that losing weight is helpful for improving vertical but due to running I don't have much weight to lose in the first place. My current plan includes increasing my calorie intake so I am actually gaining weight, as well as bodyweight workouts like jump squats and box jumps. I'm also hoping to spent time reading and watching videos about big man and power forward roles, as well. I want to focus more on ""quick twitch"" muscle development because right now my exercise is ""slow"" muscle work and endurance training.

 I measured the hoop and it was definitely 10 feet and I’ve always practiced on this hoop. However it is outdoors and the floor is now slippy as my shoes I use for outdoors have lost there grip. My indoor courts are re-opening in about a week and I was wondering will this help with my jump.

,Basketball,"Increasing vertical

Hey, I was looking for some guidance on increasing my vertical. Right now I can dunk by palming the ball, (6’6) however I get rim stuffed when I dunk while cradling the ball and dunking, I literally just need ~2 inches to get up there since I’m so close.

I understand that Bulgarian squats are really good, and lunges are good for vertical, but how often should I be doing these excercises, and how long would it take to increase my vertical by 1 or 2 inches?

Thanks, any help is appreciated

Now I'm 6'1 at 16 and I'm the 6 man on my varsity team at school just because of my slashing ability. I simply cannot drive past anyone, although my handles are pretty good. I just pull up around mid range or shoot floaters even when I'm on a 1 on 1 fast break. I rely on my shooting ability unless I have a wide open lay-up in which I stop dribbling right under the basket and bank it in and not do that while I'm driving. Even against smaller and shorter opponents I can't drive past them because I don't know when to pick up my dribble and not travel(for eurostep or a hopstep for example), so I just post up and shoot a hook or a fade away. If it somehow helps, I can even dunk. Do you have any tips to get better at driving towards the basket when an opponent is there?

,Basketball,"Hi everyone. I was finally able to get my hands on a solid portable hoop (the silverback nxt 54) which has sufficiently met my expectations, and then some. It's far and away the best portable hoop I've ever used.
