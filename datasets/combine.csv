Is it unusual that after i gained 50lbs in 5 months i somehow became more athletic,"The change in my athleticism has been insane, i can run faster,jump higher and just feel more comfortable in my body overall as i feel like i have better mobility and overall feel better at 230lbs than i did at 175. Before the weight gain i couldnt dunk despite standing at 6'5'' and couldnt even touch the rim (yeah it was that bad) but now i can do dunks that i thought were impossible before. I was also amongst the slowest players in the team and was mostly just another spot up shooter due to being incredibly slow but now i came in second at the 40yd dash at 4.46. So what im wondering is, did my weight really help with my athleticism or did i just grow into my body better over these 5 months?",0.97,98,98,63,Basketball

Hand Size,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but playing ball is the only part of life where it affects me.

Please help with the noise of my basketball practice,"I'm 16 (6ft) and have lost 20kg doing basketball drills and bodyweight plyometics in my back garden. (3 months now)

I usally do a set of plyometric workouts followed by a basketball drill (e.g: 15 jumping squats followed by, 25 left leg cross overs, 10 broadjumps, 25 right leg cross overs etc)

This week I have been working on pounding the ball on a very bouncy ball to help my handles.

I typically start my workouts at 4pm and finish at 7pm
Nothing after 7pm to be considerate.

My neighbor (neighbor X) confronted me about basketball in my backyard and how its disturbing him and his ill wife. And asked me to try play less, go to the park more or do it before 4pm.

I'm still terrible at basketball and unatheltic so reducing the hours of practice would be detrimental.

Going to the park is impossible on weekdays as it's a 2 hour trip, 30 mins to my closest but it's extremely dangerous and the rims have been removed since March.(the only one with rims is 2 hours away)

I get home at 3:30 so its impossible to play before 4pm and its even worse if I practice in the morning.

Legally I have a right to do what I want as long as it's not more than 3 hours, or between 9pm-9am.

What can I do to reduce the noise?
I was thinking of removing the grass in my backyard and build a basketball court. (As i only have a 2mx10m space to play. 6ft6x10ft)
Although regular tiles wouldn't solve the issue. I dont know about concrete. Perhaps a different material will be quieter.

I've been saving up for a backyard court for 6 months now and in another 6 I'll be able to afford it.

Untill then and after then what can I do to reduce the noise?

I keep bruising my big toe nail; question about shoe size,"I‚Äôve started a basketball league after playing a few months of pick up. My right big toe is severely bruised and painful from hitting the front of my shoes.

So I just started like officially liking basketball :D,"Ok so I know what you're thinking.

""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" 

So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

(I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) 

To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.

To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:

Russell Westbrook

And Jimmy Butler.

The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.

So after binging secret base videos, doing some research on the organization as well as watching the team get a 2nd victory over the pacers in the playoffs, I became a Miami Heat Fan.

How to increase your vertical (The way I did),"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.

* 1: You can't just do a million calf raises

I watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.

*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire body

The few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.

* 3: Learn the proper form

If you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.

* 4: Start Low with a small ball

Now not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball

* 5: Dunk every day

This tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!

These 5 super simple steps take a lot of hard work, but helped increase my vertical over 8 inches. If you want any personal advice please private message me and ill give you whatever knowledge i have!",1.0,3,3,4,Basketball

Questions on getting signed NBA memorabilia as a gift,"Hi,

I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:

* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? 

Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?

And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? 

* Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?

Guaranteed Way To Become Harder To The Court," 

Creating space is a major key to becoming harder to guard on the court. The best players int he world can create space whether it's for a jumpshot, or a layup.

So what's the best way to create space??

Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!

You can do a sidestep, stepback, fadeway, whatever you need to get your shot off. The point remains the same. Attack &amp; React!",0.76,2,2,0,Basketball

I feel like I am losing brain cells during this argument and losing knowledge about basketball, I know this guy is a casual though because he says Lebron should've won DPOY and is still a better defender than AD. This guy is hurting me from how bad his takes are. so I just wanted to ask if there's legitly anyone else who believes Bam is a better defender than AD, or if there is a legitimate argument between their defense, because to me, theres no comparison between the 2 players.

Need a Strategy to help beat my Friends in a fullcourt 2v2,"My friends and I are starting to play full-court 2v2s for fun. We lost this one, but I want to win the next one by making a strategy to beat them.

Me - 5'10 - Can heat up and shoot from anywhere, also got a bit of a handle to beat defenders off the dribble with but not that physical.

My teammate - 5'9 - Big but not fast, can get a rebound and put it back up. Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.

Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.

&amp;#x200B;

We lost our first match up today by 3 points. I had some good moments but I didn't play well overall, losing my shooting rhythm after a couple of misses on a bad park rim. Tried to run pick and roll with my teammate, but Opponent #1 gave me trouble and ended up costing us two turnovers near the end of the game. I can get a shot over him in an iso, and I haven't really tried to drive on him since he's pretty athletic. I can't really drive past any of them since big guy cant shoot and the paint is clogged. All of this would be solved if I didn't lose my hot hand, and they would be forced to play up leaving the paint open for my teammate. I was thinking of getting my teammate to be guarded by opponent #2 to try to get a post shot off, but then again opponent#2 is pretty physical. Anyone know what I should do?",1.0,1,1,2,Basketball

More athletic?,"Hey everyone, 
I'm  5'10-11/ 178-9cm 
15 years old 
And if it matters (hopefully not) Asian

So for the past 4months since April, I haven't got the chance to get back on the court. Hence, I decided to work on my athletism, running faster jumping higher etc.

My standing vert has increased by at least 4-6 inches and is at 27inches now. Same with my running vert at 32 inches. I didn't do any test on my running speed. 

My question is, how much more can I improve? 

Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.
Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.

Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new. 

Also any good cardio exercises that I can do indoors? And what exercise did u do that really pushed ur athletism to the next level?

Advice for young players,"Looking back at my basketball career as I'm going to college, the highest level I played was Varsity and even on that team I wasn't very good. So my biggest advice to young players is to play more. It may not be the smartest idea right now during quarantine so make sure you stay safe.

Anyway, at my HS I was very introverted so didn't have a lot of friends that played b-ball but I loved it and practiced a lot by myself. Shooting drills, handling drills, analyzing pro games. I was trying everything to make myself improve BY MYSELF. And that was the greatest problem, there's only so much you can do by yourself.

You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.

The only time I played with others was during team practices and games. The people on my team were constantly playing every weekend with friends.

So this is my greatest advice. Play pickup or something. And most importantly, make sure you have fun. I'm gonna be honest, I hated practicing by myself because it was boring and exhausting and repetitive and frustrating. Not very fun. Playing with friends will be great.",1.0,111,111,9,Basketball

Fouls while driving/defending drives,"Hey, I'm a bit of a beginner regarding rules and I mostly play street with some friends. I would like some clarifications regarding a rule since I can't find it anywhere on Google: 

1So when I play defense, I mostly play man to man. And when my opponent starts to drive, i tend to end up in a shoulder to shoulder (side to side) sort of contact with them, where I'm on the inside (in relationship to the hoop). There's no other contact initiated by my part (no hand/forearm) just shoulder to shoulder. Is that considered a foul?

Inconsistent shooter that could use some advice,"My strength is in my drives, but every time i play 1v1 I am not able to use them. People just take so much distance from me they force me to shoot. I am an inconsistent shooter however.

How do I fix my release," So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it. 
 So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand. 

 I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:

1. I'm too weak

2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball

3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens

4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or hand

There's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.
I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release. 
 Oh, also, if any of you have any tips for my guide hand, then please tell me!

Hi all (I hope this is not a generic question).,"But I used to play a decent amount of basketball (around 2.5 hours training per day) for around 3 months, and my humoshot improved and so did my stamina.  However, my actual movement at the time was quite clunky/robotic apparently. So now I wanna get back into basketball, so I was wondering how can I make my moves more fluid and natural. Btw I have already done some flexibility/strength/stamina stuff in the last month. Also the moves I wanna concentrate on are stepback, crossover, sidestep, drive, and maybe fade away.

Weight Lift Plan,"Hey guys!
I am from Germany and 21 years old.

I don‚Äòt want to do casual weight lifting anymore. I want to do basketball related excerises that improve my strength, stamina, stability and atlethics.

It's really making it hard for me to watch. The refs made some controversial and downright wrong foul calls late in the games today (bucks/heat game 2 and game 7 rockets/thunder) , but I think it's largely from an endless barrage of criticism from players and coaches that they receive that makes their job even harder.

"Question: how to defend 1-on-1 post moves, specifically hook shot and fadeaway","The other day I was playing 1-on-1 with a friend who is of similar height, strength and speed.  Given that there's no shot clock, whichever one of us is on offense has been consistently able to get to the post via driving, then backing down the defender.  Once the offense is close enough (around the second hash mark in the paint), he initiates a series of back-to-the-basket post moves that usually ends in a hook shot or fadeaway jumper.

On defense, neither of us have been able to block or affect the shot of the fadeaway / hook shot, so the point pretty much comes down to whether the shooter misses or not.

Ideally as the defender, I would like to prevent the offense from getting so close to the basket, but it's very difficult because the offense can always make progress and back his way closer to the basket, but as the defender I can't really legally push him away from the basket.  Also, if I really try to apply a strong force, I risk the offense using my momentum against me to do a baseline spin for the easy layup.

Anyone have any ideas how to check the fadeaway / hook shots? Or is this why professional NBA players have dribble limits when they play 1:1, because otherwise it would be too easy for the offense?",1.0,1,1,5,Basketball

Poem for the game I love,"A poem i composed about my love for Basketball.

I walk into the court full of lights,

The fans on their feet all buzzing with joy,

My family waving with smiles,

I'm glad they've seen who I've become.

The ball is passed to me &amp; i dribble onward,

A screen to the left &amp; I shoot,

A 3 pointer &amp; i'm now in the zone,

We jostle back &amp; forth with many points scored,

A bit of fouls &amp; timeouts used,

The game moves on.

I look around &amp; see my teammates  I've played with,

I'm glad they accepted me &amp; encouraged me to be better,

With endless days of sweating &amp; training,

we are proud of we've become &amp; now bonded by ball,

with trust &amp; love, we move on as family &amp; as one we ball.

Dunks &amp; shots fill the court,

layups &amp; 3's scores the point,

a pass to my mate &amp; the clock tic tocks,

with head up high the court is scanned,

I'm free, he passes &amp; this is it,

scared of ending the game is who i am,

With trust in his eyes I shoot the ball,

 A 3 point shot &amp; the game we win.

With smile &amp; joy we celebrate our win,

Now champions of the league i hang my shoe.

I open my eyes with a smile &amp; realize it's all dream,

In order to achieve my dreams I need to train some more,

Stopping the sound of the ball?,"I always played a bit of basketball when I was younger (for school teams and just general messing around). However I only recently got my own net for my back garden. 

Before I got it I decided that I would not bounce the ball in my back garden and would just focus on shooting, as I know the noise can be quite irritating. I have stayed true to this but every time I take a shot the bounce still sounds quite loud. I tried rebounding all my shots before the bounce but that obviously didn't work very well.

There is also sometimes the problem of a stray bounce off the rim that goes towards my window. 

I was looking at returners but it seems the only affordable ones are the ones that collect made shots only. I was wondering if anyone knew of any affordable ones that collected missed shots? Would also be open to other suggestions to solve the noise problem.

I can typically extend my range a few steps behind the 3 point line too but if a guy just stands in front of me and I have the ball I freeze. I can do just about everything else fine on the court but this, especially when my shots not dropping and my confidence is low I‚Äôll literally just force a shot over my defender or pass it back.

Why do lots of NBA players jump before shooting?,"My best guess is that by jumping before shooting they can focus more on the horizontal distance the ball travels rather than how high it goes, but surely it's more beneficial to combine arms with legs? 

There are many players who do this, so it would make more sense to give examples of those who don't, like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard.

As for me, I prefer to shoot while jumping as opposed to after jumping, as I always seem to undershoot when I  do the latter. I feel like shooting midair just introduces another variable to keep track of, and I often lose balance (or maybe I'm just not athletic enough to pull shots like that off). Maybe height matters?

Contrary to that, maybe my form is a bit off, so I would be accepting of any tips for shooting midair (since I am quite short and shooting over defenders would be beneficial)

"As a Basketball Fan, This Sucks","Wanted to share a short piece I wrote.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. For myself, and so many others, watching NBA basketball has always been a way to escape. A way to escape the adversity and hardships in our daily life, and the inherent pain and suffering that we all experience as human beings. The NBA allowed me to dream like a kid again, to dream of my childhood team winning a championship, to dream that I could soar like Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But, my favorite thing about the NBA and sports, is the way that it brings people together. People from all walks of life, united, regardless of color or religion, rooting for one purpose. The chance to win.

As a basketball fan, this sucks. In times like these, with the kind of year that *we all* have had, we needed sports. We needed an escape, now, more than ever. We desperately needed a reminder, of what it was like to hope, to believe, and to dream again. I wish that the NBA would continue on so that I could continue to escape reality and continue living in the comfort of my own bubble. But, that would be taking the easy way out. The reality is, we would never grow, evolve, or improve if we never left our comfort zones and turned a blind eye to issues that made us feel sad or uncomfortable.

So yes, as a basketball fan, this sucks. But this is bigger than basketball. Our country needs change, now, more than ever.

Mens Basketball leagues starting up again?,So I graduated from college this past spring and played a ton of pick up ball during my four years.

any NBA players can dunk if they wanted to.,"Not sure if this has been posted before but it‚Äôs been bothering me seeing a lot of people on here and other online posts saying certain NBA players (shorter) can‚Äôt dunk. However, I believe that every NBA player can dunk if they wanted to. People may try to make the argument that ‚ÄúNate Robinson, IT, Spudd Webb could only dunk because they were super athletic‚Äù. However, they disregard the fact that to make the NBA at that height, it is imperative that they will be extremely athletic! A little background, I am on the shorter side (5‚Äô10) playing at the college level, and most guys my height (and shorter) have no problem dunking (even if off a lob). Not only at the college level are people below 6‚Äô dunking, but even in high school. If high school kids are able to slam it with ease, wouldn‚Äôt it be obvious that an NBA player would be able to dunk?

How do you become a better scorer (not just shooter)?,"I just play casually.

I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.

I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!

Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.

It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.

Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.

I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.

TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But in 5v5 my player defends the shot super close, and if I drive a help defender comes in and the paint is clogged. And there never seems to be enough space to work my defender off the dribble. I don't have any scoring moves or dribble moves, I just do basic stuff so maybe i need to improve that.",1.0,4,4,24,Basketball

4. Has greatest differences in intensity in different parts of games
5. Unorthodox rules (ex. Winner's ball etc

Waist pain,"Hello everyone 

It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. 

To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  
I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that? 

Any help or oppinion is greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much in advance.",1.0,1,1,4,Basketball

Youth Coaches: Stop Playing Only Zone Defense,"This is a message to youth coaches that want to try and help your kids grow as players. I coach Freshmen basketball, and one of the biggest hurdles I face each year is teaching kids how to play man-to-man defense. 

Within recent years, I‚Äôve noticed that the majority of youth coaches exclusively teach zone defense, and kids usually aren‚Äôt taught the basics of man-to-man defense. Even my best players that travel all over and play AAU ball have no idea what a weak-side rotation looks like or how to guard a pick-n-roll outside of a switch.

I hear kids say things like ‚Äúyour man put up 20 points on you‚Äù without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they‚Äôre only responsibility is the player they‚Äôre assigned to.

Please teach your kids how to play man-to-man, even if it means losing a game or two or getting some push back from kids/parents that don‚Äôt know any better. It‚Äôll be worth it in the long-run.",0.8,3,3,3,Basketball

"You are not a NBA player, stop shooting threes unless you are extremely efficient","I quit basketball 10 years ago due to various reasons. I starting playing again March and joined a recreational league last week. I am a pretty decent center 6'7 and my post moves are still pretty solid. However I cant dribble a ball to save my life. So I dont dribble, I pass, post moves get to the rim etc. I played in a recreational league before and I dont think I have ever shot a three in a serious match(I am a center but still)

But for the love of god and this annoys me so much: why does everyone think shooting threes is efficient. I havent seen anyone who averages above 25% in shooting drills so why the fuck do you think it is a good idea to shoot threes. They are the most wasteful shot in basketball unless you are an elite level player.

10 years ago seeing a three in recreational league was a rare thing, nowadays people just accept that guards can shoot threes if they  are open, it is so inefficient.",1.0,6,6,5,Basketball

Today I met a pro player at the court I practice at and he gave me a masterclass!,"So today I went to this little court I go to practice basketball (just to stay fit, and because I love the sport) (for clarification: I've never played more than high school level and have never practiced in a team, with a proper coach, routines etc. I always played with friends though, and tried to get it right and improve, but nothing serious. I started playing again in my 40's because it seemed a good way to stay fit and exercise outdoors)

So this dude comes around and starts shooting. I immediately see that he's very good. He starts nailing triple shots with perfect shooting form without any effort and I'm realizing the guy's a beast. So I go up and say hey, can I ask you for some advice?

I didn't want to interfere with his routine or training, I was just looking for a quick tip.

But the dude immediately drops everything and starts giving me a detailed explanation, asking me to follow his moves, do this, look at that. Correcting me, encouraging me, explaining again. Checking if I followed instructions. He even pulls out his phone and records me twice and shows me in slow motion what was I doing correctly and what I was doing wrong.

With just a 3/4 tips, he has been able to change my shooting form completely, and now it feels so easy, so effective and effortless. I was able to balance the force used better, to focus on my aiming more, and my body just felt right throughout all the shooting move.

Turned out he is a pro basketball player, he plays 2nd national division in my country and is here on vacation lol. He made my day. He was so supportive and nice, even when we chatted for a while afterwards.

Have I learned to shoot incorrectly?,"Hi, I'm 23 and relatively new to basketball in the sense that I have not played in games much (only shooting around for fun).

The release feels really satisfying and smooth, and it is more accurate than when I shoot with two hands from any point on the court.

Street Ball Rules for Making a Basket after calling a Foul,"Recently I was playing basketball with some friends. I drove to the basket and was fouled while taking a layup, thus prompting me to call the foul in the middle of my shot. The layup proceeded to fall and I just assumed the bucket would count and I‚Äôd get the ball back (we were playing 2v2 winners ball). However, the opposing team was adamant that me calling foul (even before I made or missed the shot) negated the points scored. This made absolutely no sense to me because then are you supposed to just never call foul in hopes of making the basket and not negating it? Additionally it takes more skill and finesse to finish through a foul so the points are especially earned. In every other form of basketball you‚Äôre allowed to get a foul call and still try and finish the bucket if you‚Äôre in the shooting motion. Why is street ball different?",1.0,1,1,4,Basketball

Tips for raising the net?,"So I have posted a few things about what to do to get better, almost everyone says to raise the net to 10 ft (I play on 8) and I think I‚Äôll try it, I have been slowly raising the net from 8ft to 9 and just hit 9 yesterday, i want to go straight to 10, but I always fear it going into the streets or bouncing too far away and me having to go back and forth to get it which will get annoying, but I think I‚Äôll try it, so my question is what should I be focusing on when I raise the net, layups?

Basketball back pain injury,"  

I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. 

However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.

I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. 

I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). 

After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.

I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. 

I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. 

The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. 

I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. 

Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. 

I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. 

I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. 

**Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here‚Ä¶** 

I'll end with this‚Ä¶

My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology. It taught me that things are ever-changing, and it is essential to go with the flow, accept your situation, and figure out how and what you can learn from it.

We adapted a new rule at the court I play at.,"Instead of the classic old ""shoot for it"" or ""ball don't lie"" rule, we adapted a rule where if there is an argument or controversy,  each team takes turns getting the ball. If team x got the ball first, upon the first argument, team y would get it. What do you all think about this rule. Should it be adapted at all courts. I always absolutely hated the shoot for it rule. The BALL DOES LIE. And the rule is heavily favored for people that are good at shooting 3s. Often I see this rule abused. A good three point shooter will just start an argument about a call, then he'll shoot for it and likely make it. It's a win-win situation.  It just doesn't make sense how this street rule got started.",0.86,5,5,2,Basketball

PSA to all you young players out there. STOP WORRYING ABOUT VERT! I am. It saying don‚Äôt train your legs to be strong and to explode. But I promise promise promise you should know that vert is one of the easier things to get and one of the least important parts to a good player,"
Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  

Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6‚Äô6‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt hurt but he isn‚Äôt jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  

I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you‚Äôll gain vert. It‚Äôs that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time.

Standing Jump Higher than Running Jump,"Note: TL;DR at bottom

Hi everyone. Before I explain my issue, here‚Äôs some information about me:

Today, I got a basketball hoop after being without one for a couple years due to moving across the country. I‚Äôm in my late teens, and I‚Äôve grown a lot since the last time I played basketball. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4 now, and I decided I wanted to try learning how to dunk. 

I called one of my friends who regularly plays basketball and has been trying to dunk for a while now (he‚Äôs about 6‚Äô0.5). He told me to show him my standing jump, and I was able to touch the rim (10ft hoop), but not higher. He then told me to try getting a running start to increase my vert. I did, and I kept reaching a couple inches below the rim at my peak height. Can anyone give me some tips so I can gain some inches on my running jump instead of losing a couple of inches? Thanks.

TL;DR: 6‚Äô4. Just started trying to dunk. Can touch rim on 10ft hoop with standing jump. Can‚Äôt touch rum on running jump. Can anyone give me tips on how to go higher with running jump? Thanks.

Note: My hoop is on a slight incline of about 2-3 degrees so that might affect it, but that shouldn‚Äôt make my running jump lower than my standing right?",1.0,2,2,2,Basketball

Hey i want some advice for my position,"First of all i'm korean so plz understand me for my poor english skills

I'm 5'11 tall and my wingspan is similar to my height i'm pretty muscular so i played as a small forward or sometimes undersize Pf when i was in high school and i'm just a amateur not a pro

Recently i participated a basketball club where guys play just for fun 

The old members asked me about my position and i said i'm sf

Then they told me i'm a bit small for a sf( normally in korea pg-5'9 sg-5'11 sf-6'1 pf-6'3 C-6'5 and above for amateurs)

And they suggested me to play as a oversize pointguard or shooting guard cuz i have height advantage as a pg and i may have problem guarding opponent sf with my size

But the problem is i'm not a 3-point shooter. my favorite spot is elbow or 0-15feet midrange shots and drive in finished with layups

And i'm 25 yrs old so i don't think i can learn to play as a guard since i played most of the games as a forward 

Do you think i should learn to play as a guard since i can have height and strength advantage? Or should i just keep playing as a forward cuz i'm used to it

Let‚Äôs discuss.,"Anthony Davis.
Over-rated.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong.
Hear me out.
Individually, he is great and his stats state that.
Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.
Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn‚Äôt be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn‚Äôt embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that‚Äôs like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus. So, the credit is due and he is yet to earn his due. #Facts",0.81,3,3,1,Basketball

Inner Game of Tennis,"Just finished the inner game of tennis yesterday, and I would like to say that that book has personally completely changed the way I played basketball. Originally, everytime I stepped on the basketball court, I would play under so much pressure that I would fold the ball over. I was always really good at scrimmaging and practicing, so I managed to make a circuit team. However, I would always over think in games and choke. After reading this book, I have finally understood how to truly play in game. Played a adidas gauntlet team yersterday and got my first double double. I know there much to improve on, but my performance has skyrocketed ever since reading the book. I highly recommend this book if you struggle with this problem like I do.

Just watched my first Jordan game and I'm in awe,"I've been watching basketball for years but never stopped to watch an entire game from the man himself (or any old/legendary game), and today I decided to do just that, a 55 point MJ one against the Knicks (Ewing was amazing too) and not only the game dynamic was different, it flowed a LOT better, as there were fewer pauses and fouls, there was more *game* in the game, and Michael's playing is out of this universe

I'm amazed on how different (and in many ways, better) basketball was in general. Even the broadcast and image were a surprise, it had a certain glare, and the crowd, soundtrack, and the overall scheme was so surprising, it was a beauty to look at, visually, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen, it's stunning. 5 hours later, I'm watching a Rockets x Bucks game and I can't help but feel that ""it's great but not the same thing"" feel in the back of my head (the absence of a crowd doesn't help a bit). 

I know we have the second best ever with LeBron today, but it's like something was lost with time, it doesn't get as ""grand"" as this old Bulls X Knicks game felt to me. Idk.

If you feel like it, recommend some legendary games for me to try and find through the internet to increase my knowledge of the greats before the 2000s",0.94,75,75,25,Basketball

On the other side, when the length of the video is around 90-100 minutes then you know the game ended in the regular time. Even though in the end I don't know who won the game, it takes the excitement out of the game in the end when you know if it does/doesn't go to overtime.

How do I develop a healthy relationship with basketball?,"At this point, I've really accepted that I'm addicted. Basketball and just working out in general have been my escape from everything, from the demands of life. It's the only place that I feel healthy tbh. Basketball's the only place where I've made friends that are real friends who I could really connect with. It's the only tim I felt like I'm alive and my life feels awesome cause of it. Sure, the road is full of challenges. Sure, I don't have the talent to make it to that level I always fantasize about. But basketball's something that reminds me that not everything is full of shit. It's that one thing, that constant challenge that helps fill this emptiness inside of me. 







But I gotta come clean today. If I had control over my life like that, maybe I'd be able to have a healthier relationship. But sometimes you don't and you feel that craving. ""It was supposed to be this way but it wasn't that way and you can't do anything about it."" If I got to hoop during all those missed opportunities, maybe life would be different. But I always get that reminder everyday that my life is _not_ about basketball and it constantly gets me to ask ""why?"" I always daydream about what it would be like if I were some hotshot in the league living the good life. 







I always get that reminder everyday that I'm not good enough. I play like it sometimes. I look good sometimes. But I'm barely good enough to even make varsity. I could, but with all this covid bullshit, maybe not this time. Some of it's on me. Mentally, my game is not always in the right place, and the reality is I suck. I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. 







It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play. Unfortunately, it's always gotta be that stuff I can't control getting in the way. And that's what really does make me upset and addicted.







Sorry I wasted everyone's time here. I really needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it's the fact that life's returning to normal over here. More school, more house chores, more family, and less basketball. I felt it. I felt it in quarantine, myself getting better. But today, I lost it. I lost all the confidence I had built up for months. I just don't feel the same anymore, and maybe it's because I wanna go back to the days of working out 2-3 times a day instead of once. You just feel your goals, your dreams in your grasp a bit, mayne not the NBA dream but the promise of freedom and a good life, then it slips away and goes farther than it was the last time.",0.77,9,9,10,Basketball

"6'6, hoping to increase vertical, build explosiveness, and utilize my height","I played basketball as a kid growing up but stopped in middle school as I had focused on other sports. However, I've been hoping to get back into it and I am realizing that despite being 6'6 I have virtually no vertical (can grab rim but that's it) and lack the power and explosiveness to really improve my game. Also, since the last time I played basketball I was like 12 years old and I never learned how to properly utilize my height. 

Some background: 20M, 6'6 and about 180 pounds which is pretty skinny. I consider myself ""in shape"" because I am a runner usually doing 45-90 minute runs at a decent pace, however this type of fitness is not helping me with my vertical or overall explosiveness. Most of my runs are aerobic but I occasionally do some faster paced anaerobic training.

I have heard that losing weight is helpful for improving vertical but due to running I don't have much weight to lose in the first place. My current plan includes increasing my calorie intake so I am actually gaining weight, as well as bodyweight workouts like jump squats and box jumps. I'm also hoping to spent time reading and watching videos about big man and power forward roles, as well. I want to focus more on ""quick twitch"" muscle development because right now my exercise is ""slow"" muscle work and endurance training.

Are there some other things I should focus on or think about as I begin trying to improve my game? Any general advice about getting back into basketball would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!",1.0,3,3,3,Basketball

I never took it serious until this year with everything getting shut down I figured it was the perfect time to get my skills up. My shot has drastically improved. I was always the guy pulling up from 3 with terrible form. I seem to have found my range (post &amp; mid range mostly)  &amp; when I‚Äôm in a groove can extend to the 3. However obviously I‚Äôm not Steph Curry and sometimes I just can‚Äôt buy a bucket. Because of my history of being a terrible shooter, whenever my shots aren‚Äôt falling, I lose confidence &amp; it‚Äôs essentially game over on the offensive side for me. And if my shots aren‚Äôt dropping the defense sags off &amp; clogs any open lanes. When I‚Äôm in a rhythm I have no difficulty slashing or cutting, but I can‚Äôt seem to get aggressive &amp; go to the bucket if my J‚Äôs don‚Äôt fall. How do I get over this hump? I still have to keep working on my game &amp; improve my shooting &amp; I work on it. But I just can‚Äôt seem to get over this issue. I‚Äôm definitely not a ball hog but I want to be efficient &amp; not hurt my team with bricks or nervously attacking then getting the ball ripped. I know confidence comes from putting in the work. So should I just keep working &amp; eventually things will open up? Or are there any tricks to help? Any exercises to aid? 
My passing is above average I‚Äôd say as well so players closing out on slashes gets me to give up the ball. Should I just attack &amp; dish out if they collapse when my shot isn‚Äôt falling? I‚Äôm trying to find the best way to be efficient &amp; help the team so any tips are appreciated.",0.99,1,1,9,Basketball

Need help finding a team to cheer for,"Hey all, first time posting here as I‚Äôm just looking to spark my love of basketball again for the first time in decades since I miss sports so much. 

Grew up in the late 80s - early 90s and was already a big Chicago Bears fan for football, so cheering for the bulls was a no brainer with how exciting their lineup was. 

After the team went their own ways, I kind of lost interest in ball and started following other sports more closely and only know what I know about basketball from big news in the game and playing 2k casually. 

I‚Äôm a die hard Chicago Bears and Washington Capitals fan in football and hockey; which are the two sports I follow the most closely in other sports so I don‚Äôt have a default city to cheer for. 

Just looking for a team that has some exciting players, is overall good; but not a shoe in to win since I don‚Äôt want to be a bandwagon fan. Obviously since I‚Äôm a Bears fan, I don‚Äôt mind some disappointment in my sports cheering.

scarecrow), but when ball handler tries to get past me I bend my arms so that my upper arms are   
against my torso and my forearms are at a 90 degree angle but the arms are within my cylinder,   
so the offensive presses into my arm while I shuffle with them, they try to knock down my   
forearm but it always there in the same position, is this legal?

Q2- During defense when the ball handler has either his back ro me or is at 90 degree angle at me          
(where his shoulder faces me) is it legal to keep a hand on him, no force is applied just a soft touch   
so I know he's there while I scan the court.

Now the problem is that I've been trying to improve my handles but having the finger taped is unfortunately limiting me quite a lot.

tips to get better at slashing?,"I'm 16 years old, 6'1"" and I've been playing basketball for the past 2.5 years. I started playing late cause I was into soccer until I was 14(I'm European and soccer is more famous here, but I was quite short as well,til' I hit a 8 inch growth spurt aged 12-14 and went from 5'2 to 5'10 when I was in 7th grade. Now I'm 6'1 at 16 and I'm the 6 man on my varsity team at school just because of my slashing ability. I simply cannot drive past anyone, although my handles are pretty good. I just pull up around mid range or shoot floaters even when I'm on a 1 on 1 fast break. I rely on my shooting ability unless I have a wide open lay-up in which I stop dribbling right under the basket and bank it in and not do that while I'm driving. Even against smaller and shorter opponents I can't drive past them because I don't know when to pick up my dribble and not travel(for eurostep or a hopstep for example), so I just post up and shoot a hook or a fade away. If it somehow helps, I can even dunk. Do you have any tips to get better at driving towards the basket when an opponent is there?

"Ideas for self-made ""base rebounder"" for portable hoop?","Hi everyone. I was finally able to get my hands on a solid portable hoop (the silverback nxt 54) which has sufficiently met my expectations, and then some. It's far and away the best portable hoop I've ever used. However, there is just one design omission that some other slightly more expensive hoops have (the spalding ultimate hybrid)... which is a ""base rebounder"" --- something that I am finding would be extremely useful. My hoop has two unprotected arms stemming out from the main pole to the front of the base assembly. For the most part not a HUGE problem, except when I'm practicing free throws. When you're swishing those suckers one after the other, it's frustrating that each time you hit one the ball careens off in every conceivable direction... essentially a middle finger to me for hitting each shot.

Anyway, long post for a very simple question: Has anybody here gone through the effort of creating a ""base rebounder"" for your hoop, and if so, how did you do it?",1.0,1,1,1,Basketball

Dribble,"I just started playing basketball and I wanna star by learning how to dribble which is probably the most important so I watched some videos on YouTube and they tell to dribble the ball with the fingers which I can do fine but when they start dribbling they kinda turn it with their hand and it looks so much more cool than just doing it with the fingers and in some cases it‚Äôs probably more useful but isn‚Äôt it against the rules?

Why did my vertical leap get worse?,"About 3 months ago I could touch a 9'7"" by grabbing it. I stayed the same height since then. 9 days ago I decided to lose some weight plus get my vert higher through workouts including running, jump-squats and jumproping until my legs got very sore. Then I would drink some whey protein (with water) afterwards to help my muscles recover. The next day I would eat healthy and repeat. I've lost 2 pounds over 9 days but today I tried grabbing the rim, but I could only touch it with my fingertips. I'm 5'8"" and soon to be 14.

What NBA player from any time period do I seem like?,"Im 5'3-5'4, 96.5 pounds, and can jump pretty high. Ive been working really hard on my mid-range, so that's probably the most reliable factor of my game. Other than that, Im often the fastest on the court and i have ok handles but not as good as i would like. I can finish decent too. My 3 point shot is wildly inconsistent, especially since I recently decided to fix my shooting form. Ive been told my defense is pretty annoying for a small guy too, but I can't defend people who are tall and long because of my obvious physical disadvantages.",1.0,1,1,2,Basketball

# Match events

1': Today's match has just started, enjoy the game!

11': David Alaba (Bayern Munich) commits a rough foul. Anthony Taylor stops the game and makes a call. The referee points to the penalty spot. Sevilla are awarded a penalty kick!

13': **Goal! Lucas Ocampos (Sevilla) runs up to the ball, stops and waits for Manuel Neuer to commit before slotting the penalty into the bottom left corner.**

22': Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) misses a good chance to score. An inch-perfect cross into the box finds Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) who rises for a header, but sends the ball well over the bar. The ball is out of play. A goal-scoring opportunity from a corner for Bayern Munich.

26': Golden opportunity! Benjamin Pavard (Bayern Munich) lost his marker inside the box, only to shoot just wide of the left post after receiving a good pass. The ball goes out of play and Sevilla will have a goal kick.

30': Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) hits a rasping drive from inside the box after latching onto a lofted pass, but it's straight at Bono and he makes a comfortable save.

34': **Goal! Leon Goretzka (Bayern Munich) displays his shooting ability and the ball sails inside the back of the net!**

45+3': The end of the first half.

---

45': The whistle blows and Anthony Taylor starts the second half.

51': Goal! Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) takes a shot which goes past the goalkeeper!

52': Wait! Referee Anthony Taylor has indicated he is going to review the Bayern Munich goal using VAR. It‚Äôs probably to see if there was an offside in the build-up.

53': The referee looks satisfied after his VAR review and duly disallows the goal for offside. The Bayern Munich players look gutted.

56': Julen Lopetegui has decided to introduce fresh legs, with Oliver Torres (Sevilla) replacing Ivan Rakitic. Luuk de Jong also makes way for Youssef En Nesyri (Sevilla).

71': Here comes a substitution. Leroy Sane is given a rest as he is replaced by Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich).

72': Julen Lopetegui has decided to make a change. Nemanja Gudelj (Sevilla) replaces Suso.

76': One of the defenders reacts at the last minute to brilliantly block a pass from Serge Gnabry (Bayern Munich).

87': Youssef En Nesyri (Sevilla) runs onto a loose pass inside the box and releases a tremendous shot towards the bottom left corner. However, Manuel Neuer anticipates the shot and makes a brilliant save. Sevilla have been awarded a corner kick.

90': The fourth official shows 4 min. of added time.

90+4': The end of the second half.

---

91': The first period of extra-time has just begun.

92': Great touch by Youssef En Nesyri (Sevilla) as he receives a precise pass deep in the box. He rips a snap shot and the ball bounces off the goalkeeper's gloves and hits the post.

94': Substitution. Joan Jordan leaves the pitch and is replaced by Franco Vazquez (Sevilla).

99': Here is a change. Lucas Hernandez is going off and Hans-Dieter Flick gives the last tactical orders to Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich). Leon Goretzka leaves the pitch and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) comes on as a substitute.

100': Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich) receives a cross in the box and attempts to shoot, but mishits the ball and misses the goal. The ball is off of the pitch and it's a goal kick for Sevilla.

102': Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich) latches on to a precise pass and finds himself one-on-one with the keeper. He fires a low shot towards the left side of the net, but Bono leaps like a salmon to deny him.

105': **Goal! Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich) is first to latch onto the rebound near the penalty spot, and he produces a fantastic header into the top left corner.**

105+2': The referee blows his whistle to end the first period of extra-time.

---

106': Anthony Taylor has blown his whistle to start the second period of extra time.

112': The game has come to an end for David Alaba. He has contributed as much as he could today. He will be replaced by the fresh legs of Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich).

Luis Suarez's Barcelona career in numbers [credit to u/shanal183 ],"Luis Su√°rez is officially no longer a Barcelona player- probably the best striker we ever had and definitely one of the best players of all time to wear our shirt. Here's a quick statistical rundown of everything he has accomplished while playing for us, and all the records he made or broke.

* He played 283 games for us, scoring 198 goals and providing 109 assists; involved in a total of 307 goals, the third highest amount any player has produced in Europe since 2014, only behind Messi(404) and Ronaldo(341).

* Through those goals and assists, Suarez has also managed to become both the **third highest top-scorer** ***and*** **the assist provider** in the entire history of FC Barcelona, in just 283 games.

* Suarez's 109 assists since joining Barcelona is also the second highest amount provided by any player since 2014. Only one slightly ahead is Messi with his 135.

* Additionally, he is the third best all time Barcelona players in terms of goals in El Clasico, sitting at 11 and only 3 behind C√©sar.

* Suarez won the Golden Boot in 2015-16 season with 40 league goals and 18 league assists; no other player has ever managed to put better numbers in the history of recorded European Football barring Messi and Ronaldo.

* Suarez also became the **first player in the entire history of Laliga** to top the league in both assists and goals in a single season.

* In 2015-16, Luis provided 59 goals in all competition, as well as 24 assists, making it a total of 83 goal contributions. Except Lionel Messi, **no player in the history of recorded Football has had a better season statistically, not even Cristiano Ronaldo.**

* Suarez has been top assist provider in Laliga for three consecutive seasons from 2015-16 to 2017-18; becoming the second ever player in league history to achieve this feat after Mesut Ozil.

* Despite the criticism, Suarez has managed 25 goals and 22 assists, a total of 47 goal contribution in just 55 UCL games; these numbers are among the very bests in terms of pure ratios. Additionally, Suarez's assist rate in UCL with Barcelona is the second best in competition's history, after Neymar's career ratio.

* And lastly, Suarez, alongside the other two blades of MSN trident, managed 364 goals and 197 assists in just 450 games, the highest any attacking trio has ever scored *or* created in the history of top Football.",0.95,951,951,185,soccer

# Match events

1': Today's match has just started, enjoy the game!

11': David Alaba (Bayern Munich) commits a rough foul. Anthony Taylor stops the game and makes a call. The referee points to the penalty spot. Sevilla are awarded a penalty kick!

13': **Goal! Lucas Ocampos (Sevilla) runs up to the ball, stops and waits for Manuel Neuer to commit before slotting the penalty into the bottom left corner.**

22': Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) misses a good chance to score. An inch-perfect cross into the box finds Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) who rises for a header, but sends the ball well over the bar. The ball is out of play. A goal-scoring opportunity from a corner for Bayern Munich.

26': Golden opportunity! Benjamin Pavard (Bayern Munich) lost his marker inside the box, only to shoot just wide of the left post after receiving a good pass. The ball goes out of play and Sevilla will have a goal kick.

51': Goal! Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich) takes a shot which goes past the goalkeeper!

52': Wait! Referee Anthony Taylor has indicated he is going to review the Bayern Munich goal using VAR. It‚Äôs probably to see if there was an offside in the build-up.

90': The fourth official shows 4 min. of added time.

90+4': The end of the second half.

---

91': The first period of extra-time has just begun.

94': Substitution. Joan Jordan leaves the pitch and is replaced by Franco Vazquez (Sevilla).

99': Here is a change. Lucas Hernandez is going off and Hans-Dieter Flick gives the last tactical orders to Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich). Leon Goretzka leaves the pitch and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) comes on as a substitute.

100': Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich) receives a cross in the box and attempts to shoot, but mishits the ball and misses the goal. The ball is off of the pitch and it's a goal kick for Sevilla.

102': Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich) latches on to a precise pass and finds himself one-on-one with the keeper. He fires a low shot towards the left side of the net, but Bono leaps like a salmon to deny him.

105': **Goal! Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich) is first to latch onto the rebound near the penalty spot, and he produces a fantastic header into the top left corner.**

God is Bulgarian - A Brief History of Bulgaria‚Äôs FIFA World Cup Campaigns,"  It was not fun to be Bulgarian on November 16, 1993. At least if you were a football fan. Their national team needed a win against France at Parc des Princes the next day to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. But let‚Äôs have a look at the entire story and the history of Bulgaria‚Äôs World Cup campaigns.

# The First of Bulgaria‚Äôs World Cup Campaigns

Bulgaria were in an equally miserable situation 32 years earlier, as they needed a victory against France to qualify for the 1962 World Cup. France and Bulgaria finished on equal points in their qualifying group, so a play-off match would be played on neutral soil to determine which of the two nations qualify. The Bulgarian‚Äôs recorded an astounding 1-0 against Le Bleus, securing a place at their first-ever major tournament. However, their performance at the World Cup was disappointing, losing respectably to Argentina 1-0, before being demolished 6-1 by Hungary. A 0-0 draw against England in their final group game rounded off their campaign.

# Four Consecutive World Cup Appearances

Bulgaria subsequently went on to qualify for every World Cup up until the 1974 edition. They never made it past the group, though, failing to win a single match. After being blessed with consecutive World Cup appearances for twelve years between 1962 and 1974, they were then cursed with a twelve-year hiatus from the competition.

# Reaching the Knockout Stage for the First Time

The wait proved to be worth it, as it would be at the 1986 World Cup where Bulgaria advanced to the knockout stage for the first time ever. Reigning world champions Italy were their first opponents. Bulgaria managed to keep Italy at bay for 43 impressive minutes, but then Alessandro Altobelli gave the Azzurri the lead right on the stroke of half-time. For the vast majority of the second half, it seemed his goal was decisive. That was until the 85th minute, when Nasko Sirakov equalised, scoring Bulgaria‚Äôs first World Cup goal in twelve years, and earning them a crucial point.

South Korea were up next, a much easier foe than Italy. However, they could still only manage a 1-1 draw. Extremely disappointing, even though all hope was far from lost. Bulgaria lost 2-0 to Argentina in their final group game, but still advanced to the last 16 as one of the best third-placed teams. Group B winners and hosts Mexico proved to be too strong, winning 2-0 in front of 114,580 spectators. This World Cup was over for Bulgaria.

# God is Bulgarian

Bulgaria didn‚Äôt even come close to qualifying for the subsequent 1990 World Cup, as they finished last in their group behind Romania, Denmark, and Greece. This massive failure gave them little reason to be optimistic heading into 1994 World Cup qualifying, but Bulgaria ended up surpassing everyone‚Äôs expectations. However, they were still in third place ahead of the final matchday, meaning qualifying for the World Cup essentially was an impossible dream. After all, Bulgaria needed a win against France in Paris to qualify.¬†

The French crowd booed Bulgaria‚Äôs mighty national anthem. Little did the French know that they would boo their own players when the match was over. France predictably obtained the lead in the 31st minute through Eric Cantona, before Emil Kostadinov equalised with a brilliant header shortly afterwards. The match was tied 1-1 at half-time. This deadlock persisted for the vast majority of the second half, too, until the 90th minute. The ball once again found its way to Kostadinov, or rather he found the ball and won the game for Bulgaria with an amazing strike.  
‚ÄúGod is Bulgarian!‚Äù the commentator famously shouted as Bulgaria qualified for the 1994 World Cup against all odds.¬† ¬†¬†

# 1994 World Cup Group Stage

Bulgaria‚Äôs first match couldn‚Äôt have gone much worse, losing 3-0 to Nigeria. Their 4-0 demolition of Greece kept the Bulgarian dream alive and gave them confidence heading into their final group match against Argentina, though. It was a match where a draw would be enough to advance to the knockout stage. However, Bulgaria once again exceeded expectations, defeating *La Albiceleste* comfortably 2-0. Mexico, who had won the ‚Äògroup of death‚Äô where every team obtained four points, awaited Bulgaria in the round of 16.

# Clash with Mexico

The talismanic Hristo Stoichkov of Barcelona gave Bulgaria an early lead, but Garcia Aspe‚Äôs penalty tied the match. This deadlock could not be broken, meaning the game would have to be decided by a penalty shootout. Mexico failed to score their first three penalties and Bulgaria won the shootout 3-1. Reigning World champions Germany were Bulgaria‚Äôs quarter-final opponent.

# Sensational Win Against Germany

The game was tied 0-0 at half-time, but Lothar Matth√§us scored a penalty in the 47th minute to put the Bulgarian dream in danger. Stoichkov was determined to keep this dream alive though, scoring a superb free kick in the 75th minute. It seemed Bulgaria was heading towards a penalty shootout again. That is, until just three minutes later when Yordan Letchkov scored an iconic diving header. Bulgaria had advanced to the semi-finals where they were gonna face Italy.

# Success Yet to Be Replicated

Roberto Baggio proved to be too much for this Bulgarian team, as his brace won Italy the match. Bulgaria were hoping to redeem themselves in the third-place play-off, but suffered a 4-0 loss against Sweden. An ending unworthy of this great Bulgarian side. It was still a superb World Cup performance by Bulgaria, though, and they should be proud. They have not been able to replicate this success. Their most recent World Cup appearance being in 1998 where they only obtained one point. Hopefully, Bulgaria‚Äôs future give them reasons to celebrate again.",0.88,56,56,18,soccer

Relieving the Relegation Battle: 2015-16 EPL,"Ahh, the English Premier League. The EPL. The Prem. ***The Barclays***. The most theatrical league in world football.

Finishing midtable in the Prem is a good way to be forgotten, to be quite honest. The big teams will always be noticed; then there's Leicester City, who went and won the bloody thing in 2015-2016. And then there's the teams who finish at the other end of the table.

We don't forget those.

Ahh, 2015-2016. A vintage season. Legends were fashioned (the Vardy chatteth and the Vardy bangeth away), the defending champions finished tenth, St Totteringham's was an absolute surprise on the final day, and - in general - the world order of British football was shaken up, as two of the nation's biggest teams - 5th and 9th on the all-time table - were relegated amid circumstances that were, if not shocking, at least mildly surprising.

-------

**Day 1, Or: How I Learned to Stop Winning and Love the Gilet**

Aston Villa kicked off their Barclays campaign with a 0-1 win away at EPL debutants Bournemouth. Rudy Gestede was, back then, the most prolific scorer of headed goals anywhere in the EPL/EFL leagues. The Villa team that day has a familiar look to it in retrospect; behind supersub Gestede lay a profusion of semi-recognisable faces. In the starting XI were Ciaran Clark and Micah Richards at centre-back, Leandro Bacuna filling in at right-back; Burnley's Ashley Westwood and PSG's Idrissa Gana Gueye as part of a midfield three; ex-Celtic &amp; Swansea winger Scott Sinclair; club 'legends' Brad Guzan and Gabby Agbonlahor; and two French players I'd like to call the ""Two Jordans"". Amavi and Veretout have been playing well in recent seasons at Marseilles and Fiorentina, and could both be worth a look by the French NT. There was a third Jordan; Mr Ayew now plys his trade at Crystal Palace, and on the 8th of August he started on the right wing for Villa. Joe Cole was on the bench alongside Gestede, The Scottish Cafu (Alan Hutton), ex-Hammers midfield Carlos Sanchez, Kieran Richardson, Nathan Baker...what could go wrong, eh?

In retrospect, that starting XI - Jordans three and Gueye aside - has the look of a Sheffield Wednesday squad today, or maybe a Forest squad, or any other solid, can't-get-out-of-the-Championship team that you could care to think of. And, to be honest, it's not a *terrible* team, per se. There's some useful players in there; solid, dependable pros like Bacuna, Clark and Gary Gardner are always useful for clubs in lower midtable. It's just...difficult, in hindsight, to identify much creativity in that lineup.

Players like these are also good assets if they're paired with a manager who can get the best out of them.

Enter the gilet in a world full of suits: Tim Sherwood. 

(I mean, he's not the manager who could get the best out of these players, but he *was* the first 1/4 of Villa's managers that season.)

After that first win, Sherwood presided over a winless run that would root Aston Villa to the foot of the table. A single point against Sunderland (more on them later) came the week before the 3-2 loss in Leicester (squandering a HT 0-1 lead) that would kickstart their opponents into the greatest achievement in modern, top-level footballing history. Ten games in, on the 24th of October 2015, Villa were second-bottom of the table, on four points; the tenth round of the league had seen a 2-1 loss at Swansea (with each side's Ayew notching a goal).

-------

**It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Madley World**

At that point in the season, the bottom three of the table was filled out by the league's resident Tyneside teams, Newcastle United and Sunderland. Newcastle were in 18th, with six points to their name, and Sunderland were bottom, having sacked manager Dick Advocaat after a 2-2 draw away at West Ham. Replacing Advocaat was former Newcastle manager 'Big' Sam Allardyce 

As if by magic, the Tyneside Derby was to be played on the 25th of October.

Sunderland were bottom. Their squad featured a literal nonce; this despicable individual was continuously selected by Allardyce while he was on bail later in the season, which is something we *really should think about more* when we talk about Big Sam. Former 'Big Six' players Costel Pantilimon, Vito Mannone, Younes Kaboul, Wes Brown and John O'Shea were part of a rather rusty defence; Fabio Borini, Ola Toivonen, Jermain Defoe and Steven Fletcher were among the team's stable of strikers; and Jeremain Lens, Jan Kirchoff, Jack Rodwell, Seb Larsson, Duncan Watmore, Yann M'Vila and Lee Cattermole were in the midfield. Not exactly a vintage year, then.

Newcastle weren't much stronger, though they did have some players among their ranks who would make a considerable splash in future PL seasons or abroad. Georginio Wijnaldum, Moussa Sissoko, Ayoze Perez, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Andros Townsend, Jamaal Lascelles - even Florian Thauvin was picked on the bench for the derby. Ex-Sunderland midfield Jack Colback started on that fateful day, with No. 5 Wijnaldum playing on the wing.

There was a slight hitch, though:

Newcastle were being managed by Steve McLaren.

Yes, *that* Steve McLaren. No, there's no other Steve McLaren, I don't mean another Steve McLaren; I mean *that* Steve McLaren. The brolly guy.

# Steve Pissing McLaren.

(I mean, that's all I have to say, really.)

On the 25th of October, McLaren's Newcastle faced off against Allardyce's Sunderland. It was a case of Unstoppable Farce meets Immovable Turd; and the Stadium of Light was the S-bend.

What happened?

Well, contemporary sources at the time state that Fabricius Coloccinus got a straight red in the first half for what the referee, Bobbus Madlaei, perceived to be an illegal push on Stevanus Fletchura. (It wasn't a straight red at all.) Madley also gave a penalty, and Sunderland took the lead entering into half-time. This scoreline was against the run of play.

In the second half, Mitrovic came close but was denied by Pantilimon; but it was Billy Jones - who, when Sunderland went down the season after, would essentially relegate Hull City with a goal in the 69th minute - who found the net next, doubling the Black Cats' lead from close range. A Fletcher volley made it three, and then there were no more scores; and Sunderland left with as many points as they had goals.

It was the turning point of the relegation race. Sunderland leapfrogged Newcastle on goal difference; Aston Villa sunk down to 20th, and Tim Sherwood was duly sacked on the same day. In the course of two days, the relegation race had changed massively - but it wasn't over yet...

-------

**Sweet Sweetback's BaaaaadBassong**

Ten games into the season - and Sunderland had their first win. The sides above them could be forgiven for feeling a little nervy. Bournemouth had 8 points, Norwich City 9, and Chelsea 11.

Bournemouth had a team full of old pros; Sylvain Distin, Marc Pugh, Andrew Surman, Artur Boruc, Adam Federici, and Maryport's own Glenn Murray. Eddie Howe had coached the team to a fairytale promotion; there was no doubt his side would fight to retain their place in the Prem. Watford went up too; despite being most pundits' pick for an immediate relegation, they turned out to be the most successful side of the three, challenging for Europe in later seasons. (In a bizarre twist of fate, all three of the league's promoted teams were relegated last season.)

The third team was Norwich City. Up in the Prem again after a brief Championship sojourn, the Norwich side - which was then managed by Alex Neil - boasted the talents of summer signings Youssouf Mulumbu and Robbie Brady in midfield, with Graham Dorrans joining up with fellow Scots Russell Martin and Scott Whittaker. Loanees Dieumerci Mbokani, latterly of Hull City, and Patricio Bamfordinho added firepower up front, alongside Wes Hoolahan and Cameron Jerome.

But it was Nathan Redmond who stood out. Coming to an FPL team near you soon, Redmond was the club's best attacking threat; a burst of guile and dynamism who netted six league goals (only one fewer than the club's topscorer that season, Mbokani). 

Two more teams would be relegation candidates by the halfway point of the season.

Firstly: Swansea. Garry Monk was sacked in early December, after a 0-3 loss at home to Leicester; the talents of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Andre Ayew hadn't been enough to halt the team's precarious slide down the table. Things looked ropey; however, Alan Curtis guided them to five points in three games on a caretaker basis, with a 2-1 loss away at each Manchester side bookending his time in charge of the club. But before that second loss - the City one - Swansea stood 17th, on the 28th of December 2015.

By that point, Villa were already looking doomed; they'd only doubled their points tally in the two months since Sherwood's departure. Remi Garde was their manager, after Kevin MacDonald's interim stint in charge. Sunderland had 12 points and Newcastle had 17; Swansea were above them, in seventeenth place with 19 points, and then three teams stood level on 20:

in sixteenth place, Bournemouth;

in fifteenth place, Norwich City;

and, in fourteenth place,

Chelsea.

On the 28th, Chelsea were three points off the relegation zone, with a goal difference of -6.

Two weeks before the game - on the 17th of December, after a loss to (you guessed it) Leicester - Chelsea sacked Jose Mourinho, with Guus Hiddink seeing out the rest of the season on an interim basis. The team was in shambles. Eden Hazard hadn't scored in 25 games, Didier Drogba hadn't been replaced properly (but at least they'd signed Papy Djilobodji!), and Arsene Wenger finally beat Mourinho (after 14 attempts). It was turning into a real *annus horribilis* for Chelsea, who had stormed to the title the previous year.  

But it was Bournemouth who had taken the defining glory earlier in December. Murray's late goal at Stamford Bridge - 99 seconds after being subbed on - led them to an unreal 0-1 victory over the Blues (an apt nickname, though The Pensioners was even more suitable, given the way they played). Diego Costa was unable to recapture his 16-goal form of the previous season, while Loic Remy flattered to deceive. Radamel Falcao, meanwhile, was a bizarre acquisition (topped only by the signing of Pato in the January transfer window that followed Mourinho's departure).

It was a shitshow, but Chelsea would end up safe. Why? Easy: they simply weren't shit enough to be relegated that year.

Hoooh boy.

**Remi Garde and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Season**

 &gt; Villa are fucking shit.  
 &gt;    
 &gt; - Mark Twain

It says a lot when you're forced to recall Aly Cissokho from his loan midway through the season.

On the 18th of December, the error-prone left-back (*sticky sticky*) made his glorious return to Villa Park.

*His was the only arrival of a player at Villa that winter.*

Despite being mired to the bottom of the table, Villa had already made a sizeable transfer outlay, of ¬£7.75m. It was poor recruitment, based upon a fairly bizarre strategy of signing promising youngsters (Amavi, Veretout, **Adama Traore**) instead of proven players. Scott Sinclair, after a year in the doldrums at Manchester City, was a gamble. Jordan Ayew scored seven goals, but losing all of Christian Benteke, Darren Bent, Fabian Delph and Andreas Weimann was a tough blow that was met with a stream of, essentially, development players. It was complacent, and failed to tackle the team's need for increased creativity. Experience was added in the wrong places; ex-City and England defenders Micah Richards and Joleon Lescott were unmitigatedly bad buys. (Also Charles N'Zogbia was still at the club.)

The year had begun with Gorillaz announcing their reunion. It ended with Aston Villa mired firmly in their Demon Days.

*(I don't know why I said that. Apparently, 2-D is a Chelsea fan, and so is Damon Albarn. Maybe Chelsea should have looked at sticking 2-D up front; he's a tall man, and couldn't have done much worse than Pato. And Noodle could be a decent replacement for Eden Hazard.)*

At the very least, one young creative talent *did* emerge during the course of the season. Jack Grealish had made his debut the previous season; in April 2015, he was featured in his first tabloid gaffe (for inhaling nitrous oxide, a year earlier); in September 2015, he scored his first goal; in the slow unending agony of the 2015-16 season, he was by far the team's best player. More recently, he was instrumental in their rise back up to the Premier League - and in their survival last year. Now he's signed a big new contract with the club. (Callum Robinson was a young Villa contemporary, but is now, ironically, at West Brom.)

In any case, the mercurial talents of Aly Cissokho and Libor Kozak failed to keep the team in the Premier League. A rare 2-0 win at home to Norwich in February Garde was sacked on the 29th of March, with Eric Black being put in temporary charge for the rest of the season. Villa's relegation was confirmed on the 16th of April with a 1-0 loss against Louis van Gaal's Man Utd at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford did the honours.

The club were on sixteen points. They were thirteen adrift of Newcastle United. It had been a diabolical season - and the worst was yet to come.

Remember that win against Norwich, in early February? 

Every Aston Villa game afterwards was a loss. There was only one point until the end of the season.

And that point was ***crucial*** to how the season ended.

-------

**The Denouement**

In the first half of the season, Sunderland lost fourteen games.

After the turn of the year, they lost half as many.

Seven losses isn't exactly a tremendous return for a team, but it demonstrates the extent of the job Allardyce had to do. On the face of it, it's not a remarkable turnaround - but adding some steel to the side, and turning what once would have been certain losses into draws, was massive for the club. Lamine Kone was a massive signing in January, while Steve Harper added depth in goal and Wahbi Khazri made some telling attacking contributions. It was Defoe, however, who was the club's saviour; without his 18 goals, there is no way that the club would have stayed up, but - miraculously - they did.

On the day Villa were relegated, Bournemouth had clambered up the table to 11th, a remarkable feat - and though they would end the season in 16th place, their survival was hardly in doubt. Crystal Palace and West Brom had slid down the table, but Alan Pardew was able to steady the Palace ship (though he was sacked the year after, being replaced - in another twist of fate - by Allardyce), and they finished 15th, with West Brom in 14th. Watford were 13th, Swansea City 12th, Everton 11th and Chelsea 10th.

Norwich beat Newcastle 3-2 at Carrow Road in April, Martin Olsson scoring the winner in stoppage time. At Newcastle, Steve McLaren was sacked on the 11th of March, with Rafael Benitez replacing him in the mother of all comebacks. Like Marco Silva at Hull the season after, Rafa did a fine job - but the side had already been doomed by their early-season form, and retaining their Premier League status was just a touch too far. 

Next, Norwich lost 1-0 at Crystal Palace. Sunderland had drawn against West Brom in a goalless affair; then they went and lost 0-2 to Leicester City. Norwich were out of the relegation zone, with 31 points to Sunderland's 30. Newcastle were four points adrift.

Then came a relegation 100-pointer, if such a thing were possible. And, at Carrow Road, Sunderland beat Norwich 3-0 (again!). The hero - the unlikely man who saved Sunderland from relegation - was Fabio Borini, who slotted a penalty home - but Defoe and Watmore also scored. This was the game confirmed Aston Villa's relegation.

It wasn't over, of course, and Norwich gamely battled on. A 1-0 loss at Arsenal left them two points adrift with three games to go, while Sunderland scraped a 1-1 draw at Stoke thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Defoe. It was touch and go stuff.

Then, while Sunderland defeated Chelsea at the Stadium of Light, 3-2, (there were seven yellow cards, and John Terry was sent off,) Man Utd beat Norwich at Carrow Road, 0-1. And, in that gameweek, Aston Villa earned a point at home against Newcastle. It was a goalless draw; a win for Newcastle would have put them level on points with Sunderland. As it was, they stayed 19th. There was no way back for them after that.

Then came the final coup de grace.

On the penultimate day of the season, Norwich City thumped Watford 4-2 at home. Mbokani scored two goals, with Redmond also notching the scoresheet - with a Craig Cathcart owngoal completing the four. But it wasn't enough. On the same day, Sunderland beat Everton by a familiar scoreline: 3-0, with a goal for each point. The Black Cats secured their safety - and, in doing so, condemned both Newcastle and Norwich to the drop. Patrick van Aanholt was the first name on the scoresheet - with two more goals from Allardyce's best signing: Lamine Kone.

It had been a valiant effort from Norwich, to say the least, but it *just* wasn't enough. On the 11th of May, exactly two months after Rafa Benitez replaced Steve McLaren, the Canaries and Magpies alike were relegated from the Premier League.

Norwich finished 18th. Newcastle finished 19th. Aston Villa finished 20th.

-------

**The Aftermath**

To compound Norwich's miseries, Everton - whom Sunderland had just thrashed - were their final-day opponents. Everton beat Norwich soundly. The score? 3-fucking-0.

Sunderland took a victory lap with a 2-2 draw in Watford. The most surprising thing about the entire season was that Rodwell and Lens scored for the Black Cats. As the world knows, now-relegated Newcastle took out their frustrations in being fucked over by their bitterest rivals by beating the everloving shit out of Spurs, who had been second for months and were the only real challengers to Leicester's dominance for most of the season. They won 5-1, even with a Mitrovic red card. Wijnaldum scored two; he was sold that summer, to Liverpool. He's now one of the best midfielders in the world. He inspired Liverpool to their second-greatest CL comeback of all time, against Barcelona - who now want to sign him. And so, the bizarre wheel of football keeps turning again, and again, and again.

Arsenal sneaked the jammiest of second-placed finishes - nobody had seen *that* coming, but I like to think of it as a final hoorah for Wenger and Gunnersaurus. It's the most recent St Totteringham's Day, and perhaps the sweetest for Arsenal fans in a loooooong time. As for Sunderland - who had survived time and time again - only one thing could do for them: David Moyes. Perhaps the fact that he got the Sunderland job, and messed it up so badly, was Everton's final revenge for the 3-0. 

...maaaaybe not.

The vacancy at Sunderland was due to Sam Allardyce's success drawing the eyes of the England national team. He became manager; to this day, he's the only England coach to have won *all* of his games in charge. Now, let's pretend nothing else happened during his tenure.

Aheheheh.

Villa went back up in 2019. They stayed up this season; a controversial midseason VAR goal against Sheffield United is, at first glance, what kept them up over Norwich, Watford and Bournemouth - but, in truth, Aston Villa deserve to stay up. They earned survival, and look like they could have the tools to compete at this level for many years to come. Grealish has matured into a fantastic leader, while John McGinn and Tyrone Mings have been fantastic additions to the team. Fair play to them. After the season I've just described, they deserve a bit of success.

Newcastle went back up again after one season. Sunderland - and Middlesbrough, who had just won promotion when this relegation dogfight was heating up - went down the other way at the same time. 

Newcastle are still in the Premier League today. 

Sunderland are not. 

They are in League One. A catastrophic relegation led to another - and led to a shockingly revelatory Netflix fly-on-the-wall documentary series being made about how this once-great club fell so disastrously into the gutter. It's a sad, sorry tale; one of tragedy, and luxury, complacency, ignorance, and selfishness taking a beloved British sporting institution to its breaking point...

Sunderland are in League One.

But, Sunderland fans, tell me this: if you but close your eyes, does it all come back to you? The chants, the swaying of the crowd, the concrete beneath your shoes...the plastic seats, the electric displays, the flash of red and white shirts at the Stadium of Light...the feeling of joyous relief...

""3-0 to Sunderland.""

#Notes and Caveats

* All club data has been taken from Transfermarkt; their definition of assists may differ from other sources.
* It's hard to find assist data for international matches.  Transfermarkt has none.  I've used worldfootball.net as a source, but it only has data for the most notable matches (basically World Cup finals and a few other tournaments).  I was able to find only one pairing on this list with *any* international goals (2 for M√ºller / H√∂ness at the 1974 World Cup).
* Assist data gets more sparse and inconsistent as we go earlier in the history of football (you can see this by clicking on any of the links in the table for an older player; it will take you to the Transfermarkt page for that player's goals and assists).
* This was basically a data-mining exercise (Transfermarkt doesn't make this particular statistic easily available).  I started with the top 25 goals/assist providers for each season, as recorded by Transfermarkt.  If there is a prolific goal/assist pair neither of whose members were among the top 25 in goal/assists for *any* season, I may have missed them.
* Because of the previous points; **the absence of a pair from this table does not necessarily mean they don't belong here; it may be that I was unable to find the data**.  Any corrections or additional data are welcomed.
* Where two pairs had the same number of goal-assist combinations, I put the pair who had played together at club level for the shorter period first.  If that didn't break the tie, I used a more even split of goals (i.e. which pair had the more goals scored by the lower-scoring individual).
* I'm sure there are some errors -- please let me know in the comments if you find any.  Thanks!",0.95,254,254,70,soccer

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

11': Travers called into action for the first time, making himself big and blocking the ball at his near post.

12': David Brooks gets off a tame shot that's easily saved, and he's offside anyway.

16': Foden plays in Mahrez at the right side but Travers runs at him and makes another good save.

18': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL MAN CITY!! What a wonderful pass from Foden and what a finish, perfectly into the top corner from *Liam Delap*!**](https://streamja.com/JoaZQ)

22': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL BOURNEMOUTH!! *Sam Surridge* given too much space, he turns and shoots and tucks it into the far side!**](https://streamja.com/3nZBP)

27': [](#icon-sub) Bournemouth substitution: *Jordan Zemura* on for *Lloyd Kelly* who goes off injured

35': Walker tries to play a long pass to Delap at the far post but Delap mishits it out.

36': [](#icon-sub) Man City substitution: *Benjamin Mendy* on for *Adri√°n Bernab√©* who has a long gash on his shin

41': Rodri with a big chance that he just misses at the top corner from distance

**HT Manchester City 1-1 Bournemouth** The two sides' young strikers have them tied with a goal apiece at the half.

-----

46': We're back!

51': After two blocked Man City shots Mahrez puts a shot over the bar.

61': [](#icon-sub) Man City substitution: *Kevin De Bruyne* on for *Rodri*

63': Foden's shot goes over.

64': [](#icon-sub) Bournemouth substitution: *Steve Cook* on for *Diego Rico*

UEFA Europa League Third Qualifying Round Preview,"The journey for the Europa League continues today as the third qualifying round kicks off with all matches bar one being played today.

The second qualifying round will see teams divided into two paths. The Champions Path consists of 8 of the 10 losers of the¬†2020‚Äì21 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round¬†(Champions Path), and 10 winners of the second qualifying round (Champions Path). The two other losers of the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round, KF Tirana and Ludogorets Razgrad, received byes to the playoff round. The Main Path consists of 13 teams who enter this round, 3 losers of the¬†2020‚Äì21 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round¬†(League Path), and 36 winners of the second qualifying round (Main Path).

Yesterday's only fixture saw Polish side Lech Poznan ease to a 5-0 win in Cyprus over Apollon Limassol, with Portuguese midfielder Tiba scoring a brace for the away side.

On to today's action and here are a few matches to keep an eye out for today:

First, Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven travel to Slovenia to face Mura FC as they aspire to reach the latter stages of this season's competition after last season's 3rd place finish in the group stages.

Celtic, who were beaten by Ferencvaros in the Champions League qualifiers, dropped to the Europa League and will travel to Latvia to face Riga FC, in the hopes of salvaging their European dreams.

Galatasaray host Hajduk Split in what should be a close tie within the two teams, while surprise package Bodoe/Glimt will visit Milan and face Zlatan and company today. 

My personal favourite Dutch side Willem II (due to my achievements with them in FM 20, thanks a lot Evangelos Pavlidis!!!!) will welcome Rangers at the Koning Willem II Stadion. 

And last but not least, Tottenham will continue their European journey as they visit Macedonia this time round, KF Shkendija their latest opponents.

The Football Alliance: How a rejected idea became a league,"In 1888-89, the Football League was founded as the top division in England. They rejected an idea to expand the league to 24 teams, so the excluded teams created their own league, The Football Alliance. It lasted 3 seasons, between 1889-90 and 1891-1892. This is the post we talk about the Football Alliance.

List of Founding Members:

***1889-90:***

The 1st season of the Football Alliance was the 1889-90 season. 12 teams excluded from the Football League were the founding members (listed above). That season, The Wednesday won the Football Alliance, 4 points ahead of Bootle and Sunderland Albion. At the end of the season, Long Eaten Rangers, who finished bottom of the league with 10 points, dropped out of the league to join the Midland Football League.

***1890-91:***

The next season, Stoke City took the spot of Long Eaten Rangers, after they dropped out of the Football League. Previous season winners The Wednesday had a terrible season, finishing last with 13 losses. Stoke City would win the league that season, and be elected into the Football League, along with Darwen, who finished in 6th. Sunderland Albion would leave to join the Northern League at the end of the season.

***1891-92:***

The final season was the 1891-92 season. With Stoke City, Darwen, and Sunderland Albion leaving the league, 3 new clubs joined, being Ardwick, Burton Swifts, and Lincoln City. Nottingham Forest won the league that season with 33 points, 2 points ahead of Newton Heath. Birmingham St George disbanded at the end of the season. Nottingham Forest, Newton Heath, and The Wednesday were elected to the First Division, while the remaining 8 teams were elected to the Second Division.

In this series I will present each of the 12 Brazilian teams that together compose the [""Big 12""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Twelve_%28Brazilian_football%29). My point is to make them more knowledgeable to you, since each one of these teams have their share of the Brazil national team success and of Brazilian club football accomplishments as a whole. I'll try to be as smooth, efficient and non-boring as I can. If the feedback is positive, I'll keep bringing more to this series. So ok, let's do this!

**Method:** I'll present the teams in a chronological order, from the oldest foundation (Flamengo-1895) to the latest one (S√£o Paulo-1930). The order will be: Flamengo, Vasco, Fluminense, Gr√™mio, Botafogo, Atl√©tico Mineiro, Internacional, Corinthians, Santos, Palmeiras, Cruzeiro, S√£o Paulo. How many of these have you heard of?

**Extra clubs:** Due to a high number of requests, I'll also present 3 teams who don't belong to the Big12, but are also considered big clubs in Brazil: **Bahia**, **Athletico Paranaense** and **Coritiba**. Welcome to the club!

**Geographical reference:** Before we start, I'd like to ask something very simple from you. I want you to keep in mind that these 12 teams are spread in 4 different States in Brazil. The club's State name is written below, next to the club's name. It has a direct link to Google Maps, so that you can check it out to make this experience more accurate.

**PLAY AND LISTEN TO PALMEIRAS ANTHEM WHILE READING** - [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiKvx0gRfaQ)

**Palestra Italia and the first decades**

Palmeiras was founded as *Palestra Italia* in 1914, by Italian immigrants in S√£o Paulo. In the 1920s, they acquired the ground of the Antarctica company, which included the Parque Antarctica stadium. On this decade, Palestra won 3 [State Leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista) and finished 2nd on three other opportunities. At this time and until 1959, there wasn't a national league yet, due to Brazil's huge size and weak infrastructure, so the State Leagues were the main tournament, which Palestra would win 5 more times in the 1930s. They also won the 1st edition of the prestigious [Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torneio_Rio-S%C3%A3o_Paulo_de_1933), a regional league attended by big teams from S√£o Paulo and Rio only.

**1942: World War II and Palestra becomes Palmeiras**

Brazil were neutral in the 2nd World War until 1942, when they declared war against the Axis (Italy, Germany, Japan). This forced every club name related to these countries to be reconsidered, so Palestra Italia became Palestra.

However, the Brazilian government demanded that *Palestra* was also removed from the club's name, despite it being a greek word. Palmeiras was then adopted, to keep the letter P and in honor of the [Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica das Palmeiras](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Atl%C3%A9tica_das_Palmeiras), an extinct club that helped Palestra on their early days.

In the 1940s, they won 4 more [State Leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista) titles, but were still behind their rival Corinthians on the overall counting - they would only surpass Corinthians in State League titles for the first time in 1972, keeping the record until 1982, to never surpass them again.

**1951: Copa Rio, Palmeiras' first club world title**

The [Copa Rio](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Rio_de_1951) was the first attempt of a club world cup, preceding the creation of the [Intercontinental Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_Cup_%28football%29) in 1960. 

**Group** | **Club** | **Qualification**
--:|:--:|:--
A | Palmeiras | 1950 State League champion 
B | Vasco (Brazil) | 1950 State League champion
A | Juventus (Italy) | 1950 Serie A champion
B | Sporting (Portugal) | 1950 Portuguese League champion
A | Red Star (Yugoslavia) | 1950 Yugoslavia Cup champion
B | Austria Wien (Austria) | 1950 Austrian League champion
A | Nice (France) | 1951 French League champion
B | Nacional (Uruguay) | 1950 Uruguayan League champion

Palmeiras placed 2nd inside their group, beating [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGC_Nice) 3-0, [Red Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_Belgrade) 2-1 and losing to [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) 0-4. In the semis, they beat [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Vasco_da_Gama) 2-1 and tied 0-0 in the return leg, before facing [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) in the final.

**Stage** | **Result** | **Attendance** | **Venue**
--:|:--:|:--:|:--
Final | Palmeiras 1-0 Juventus | 56.961 | Maracan√£
Final | Palmeiras 2-2 Juventus | 100.093 | Maracan√£
 
In the final 2nd leg, [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) opened the score at '18, but Palmeiras tied at '47. [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) scored again at '63, but Palmeiras equalized it at '77. The match ended 2-2, and **Palmeiras were crowned club world champions.**

**The 1960s: the first Academy of Football**

After the Copa Rio title in 1951, Palmeiras won one more Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament in 1951 and one [State League title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Campeonato_Paulista) in 1959, beating Pel√©'s Santos 2-1 on the last and decisive match.

In the 1960s, the Brazilian press gave Palmeiras the alias *Academy of Football*, due to the extreme class and technique of their teams. Players of the caliber of [Ademir da Guia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ademir_da_Guia), [Djalma Santos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djalma_Santos), [Dudu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudu_%28futebolista%29), [Julinho Botelho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAlio_Botelho), [Zequinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zequinha_%28futebolista%29) and [Tup√£zinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ern%C3%A2ni_da_Rosa) won Palmeiras several titles in the 1960s: 4 Brazilian Leagues (1960, 1967, 1967, 1969), 2 State Leagues (1963, 1966) and 1 Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament (1965). The 1960s Palmeiras are notably known for stopping Pel√©'s [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC) from winning almost everything in the decade.

They also reached two [Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores) finals: in 1961, Palmeiras lost to [Pe√±arol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1arol) (0-1, 1-1), and in 1968, to [Estudiantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estudiantes_de_La_Plata) (1-2, 3-1, 0-2).

**The 1970s: the second Academy of Football**

The second wave of Palmeiras' Football Academy took place in the 1970s. Still led by [Ademir da Guia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ademir_da_Guia) and [Dudu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg%C3%A1rio_Tol%C3%B3i_de_Oliveira), the club was reinforced by [Lu√≠s Pereira](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_Pereira), [Leivinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leivinha), [C√©sar Maluco](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Maluco) and [Le√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Le%C3%A3o).

Player | Period | Apps | Goals | Brazil NT caps | Goals | World Cup att.
--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--
Lu√≠s Pereira | 1968-75 | 346 | 19 | 38 | 1 | 1 (1974)
Leivinha | 1971-75 | 268 | 108 | 27 | 7 | 1 (1974)
C√©sar Maluco | 1967-75 | 327 | 182 | 13 | 1 | 1 (1974)
Le√£o | 1968-78 | 617 | - | 105 | - | 4 (1970, 1974, 1978, 1986)

Together at Palmeiras, these monsters won 2 Brazilian Leagues (1972, 1973) and 2 State Leagues (1972, 1974). In the 1974 World Cup, Palmeiras provided Brazil with 6 players (Le√£o, Lu√≠s Pereira, Leivinha, C√©sar Maluco, Ademir da Guia and Alfredo), finishing in the 4th place.

In the end, the *Palmeiras Academy* won the same number of *Brasileir√£o* titles as Pel√©'s [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC) (6) and reached the same number of [Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores) finals (2). However, they won 6 fewer State League titles (4x10). 

**Highlights** to the [1973 Brazilian League](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1973#Classifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Final) title, with only 3 defeats in 40 matches. In the **final stage**, Palmeiras beat 1-0 the strong [Cruzeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube) of [Nelinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Resende_de_Matos_Cabral), [Piazza](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_da_Silva_Piazza), [Palhinha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderley_Eust%C3%A1quio_de_Oliveira) and [Dirceu Lopes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirceu_Lopes_Mendes), away at the Mineir√£o stadium, with [this goal from Edu Bala at '74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbvbttenRww). Then they beat 2-1 another strong team, the [Internacional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Internacional) of [Figueroa](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/El%C3%ADas_Figueroa), [Carpegiani](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_C%C3%A9sar_Carpeggiani), [Valdomiro](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdomiro_Vaz_Franco), [Falc√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Roberto_Falc%C3%A3o), [Claudiomiro](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudiomiro_Estrais_Ferreira) and [Escurinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_Carlos_Machado). After Internacional opened the score, Palmeiras [tied at '77 with Ronaldo](https://youtu.be/bDPG2YDE2R0?t=32) and [Lu√≠s Pereira scored the winning goal at '80](https://youtu.be/bDPG2YDE2R0?t=132). On the last match, a 0-0 tie against [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC) was enough for Palmeiras to be **declared Brazilian champions for the 6th time.** Only 35 years later, in 2008, would a new team (S√£o Paulo FC) reach the number of 6 Brazilian League titles.

**In 1974**, Palmeiras met their archrival [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) in the [State League final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Campeonato_Paulista). Corinthians were on a 20-year title drought (since 1954) and desperately needed a trophy. In front of 122.522 supporters at the Morumbi stadium, Palmeiras won the final 1-0, [with this goal from Ronaldo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcVpKaw-bJI), and left their rivals trophyless for one more season.

In 1976, Palmeiras won their last title before a drought that would last until 1993. They won the [1976 State League title](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista_de_Futebol_de_1976) against [XV de Piracicaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_XV_de_Novembro_%28Piracicaba%29), 1-0 at home. It would also be [Ademir da Guia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ademir_da_Guia) last title at the club, before he left in 1977.

**1993-2000: the Parmalat Era**

Between 1976 and 1993, Palmeiras didn't win a single title, finishing 2nd in one Brazilian League (1978) and in two State Leagues (1986, 1992).

In 1992, however, the Italian company **Parmalat** signed a huge deal with the club, bringing expensive and talented players. In 1993 already, they won [1 State League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Campeonato_Paulista#Finals), [1 Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torneio_Rio-S%C3%A3o_Paulo_de_1993) and [1 Brazilian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_A#Final_standings). In 1994, they once again won the [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Campeonato_Paulista) and the [Brazilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_A#Final_standings) Leagues. Until the end of the decade, they would win one more [State League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Campeonato_Paulista#Final_standings) (1996), one [*Copa do Brasil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Copa_do_Brasil#Knockout_Stages) (1998), one [Copa Mercosul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Copa_Mercosur) (1998), one [Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torneio_Rio-S%C3%A3o_Paulo_de_2000) (2000), one [*Copa dos Campe√µes*](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_dos_Campe%C3%B5es_de_2000) (2000), and the most important title, the [1999 Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Copa_Libertadores). Therefore, in 8 years (93-2000), **Palmeiras** won 2 continental titles, 4 national trophies, 3 state leagues and 2 interstate tournaments - totalizing 11 major titles.

The coach appointed to start this new era of the club was [Luxemburgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Luxemburgo), who had done good works for [Bragantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Bragantino), winning the Serie B in 1989 and the [1990 S√£o Paulo State League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Campeonato_Paulista#First_phase). He stayed at the club from 1993 to 1994, and in 1996.

**1993-94: back-to-back State and Brazilian League titles**

The 16-year title drought ended in the [1993 State League final](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista_de_Futebol_de_1993#Final_3) against their archrival [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista). On the 1st leg, a 0-1 defeat, with a historical teasing by Corinthians' forward [Viola](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_%28futebolista%29), [who imitated a pig when celebrating his goal](https://youtu.be/mIlqLkIxY-Y?t=154). On the return leg, Palmeiras [smashed them with a 4-0 victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjIsqsT3qJM) (6mn33 video), with goals from [Evair](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evair_Aparecido_Paulino) (2x), [Edilson](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%C3%ADlson_da_Silva_Ferreira) and [Zinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crizam_C%C3%A9sar_de_Oliveira_Filho).

Two months later, they won the [Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torneio_Rio-S%C3%A3o_Paulo_de_1993), again against [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) (2-0 and 0-0). **In the Brazilian League**, Palmeiras dominated with 81% of points, and only 2 defeats in 22 matches. In the final against [Vit√≥ria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_Vit%C3%B3ria), two victories: 1-0 away with a goal from [Edilson](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%C3%ADlson_da_Silva_Ferreira), and 2-0 at home, with goals from [Evair](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evair_Aparecido_Paulino) and [Edmundo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_Alves_de_Souza_Neto). Palmeiras **became Brazilian champions for the 7th time**, the first club to achieve so - the second would be [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC) in 2002, then [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) in 2017 and [Flamengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo) in 2019. 

Four Palmeiras' players were elected to the [League Best XI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_de_Prata#1993): [Ant√¥nio Carlos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B4nio_Carlos_Zago), [Roberto Carlos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_da_Silva), [C√©sar Sampaio](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_C%C3%A9sar_Sampaio_Campos) and [Edmundo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_Alves_de_Souza_Neto). 

Of the 1993 team, three great players were there since 1991: [C√©sar Sampaio](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Sampaio), [Amaral](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaral_%28futebolista%29) and [Evair](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evair_Aparecido_Paulino). Parmalat brought [Ant√¥nio Carlos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B4nio_Carlos_Zago), [Cl√©ber](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ber_Am%C3%A9rico_da_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o), [Roberto Carlos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_da_Silva), [Mazinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iomar_do_Nascimento), [Ed√≠lson](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%C3%ADlson_da_Silva_Ferreira), [Zinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinho) and [Edmundo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_%28futebolista%29). **All of them** (except Amaral, Cl√©ber and Evair) played *at least 25 matches* for the Brazil NT, with two winning the 1994 World Cup (Zinho, Mazinho), three reaching the 1998 World Cup final (Roberto Carlos, C√©sar Sampaio, Edmundo) and two winning the 2002 World Cup (Roberto Carlos, Edilson).

**In 1994**, the team increased with the arrivals of [Rinc√≥n](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Rinc%C3%B3n), from Am√©rica de Cali, [Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A1vio_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o), from Rio Branco and [Rivaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaldo), from Mogi Mirim. 

They began the season winning the [1994 State League](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista_de_Futebol_de_1994), gathering 78% of the points, and losing only three times in 30 matches.

**In the** [**1994 Brazilian League**](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_de_Futebol_de_1994#Fase_final), Palmeiras led the 1st stage and then won 5 of the 6 knock-out matches. They beat [Bahia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_Bahia) twice in the QF (2-1, 2-1), and the strong [Guarani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_FC) of [Luiz√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Carlos_Bombonato_Goulart), [Djalminha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djalminha) and [Amoroso](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoroso) twice in the SF (3-1, 2-1).

**In the big final against Corinthians**, [Rivaldo opened the score with this nice goal at '45](https://youtu.be/Ab80qvsHM4w?t=110). [He scored again at '63](https://youtu.be/Ab80qvsHM4w?t=319), and [Edmundo this nice 3-0 goal at '65](https://youtu.be/Ab80qvsHM4w?t=362). The match ended 3-1, and Palmeiras only needed a tie in the 2nd leg - which ended 1-1, with [Rivaldo scoring the tie at '81](https://youtu.be/D9gXosfPRXg?t=237). 

**Palmeiras were back-to-back Brazilian League champions**, and had now 8 National League titles, a record only reached in 2004 by [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC).

Four Palmeiras' players were elected to the [League's Best XI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_de_Prata#1994): [Cl√©ber](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ber_Am%C3%A9rico_da_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o), [Roberto Carlos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_da_Silva), [Zinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crizam_C%C3%A9sar_de_Oliveira_Filho) and [Rivaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaldo).

However, in the 1994 Copa Libertadores, Palmeiras were knocked out by [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC) in the ro16 (0-0, 1-2), but they applied a sonorous 6-1 victory against [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors), [with this great goal by Roberto Carlos, assisted by Evair](https://youtu.be/Ujlk1jq2HT4?t=103).

The team got dismantled, and in 1995 they only finished 2nd in the State League, 5th in the Brazilian League, and got **epically knocked out** in the [Copa Libertadores quarter-finals against Gr√™mio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9yDSDHy_VA) (0-5, 5-1).

**The 1996 superteam: 102 goals/30 matches and State League champions**

In 1996, the coach [Luxemburgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Luxemburgo) returned to Palmeiras, after a year span at [Flamengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_Regatas_do_Flamengo).

From the 1993-94 Palmeiras squad, [Velloso](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Fernando_Velloso), [Cl√©ber](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl%C3%A9ber_Am%C3%A9rico_da_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o), [Amaral](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_da_Silva_Mariano), [Flavio Concei√ß√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A1vio_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o) and [Rivaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaldo_V%C3%ADtor_Borba_Ferreira) remained. 

**New stars** arrived at the club: [Cafu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafu) from Real Zaragoza, [J√∫nior](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen%C3%ADlson_%C3%82ngelo_de_Souza) from Vit√≥ria, [M√ºller](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller_%28futebolista%29) from Kashiwa Reysol, and [Luiz√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Carlos_Bombonato_Goulart) and [Djalminha](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djalminha) from Guarani. 

Together, **they gathered 92% of the points**, [winning 27 of the 30 State League matches](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Paulista_de_Futebol_de_1996#Classifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o_final), scoring 102 goals and conceding only 19. Since a 100%-rate title campaign in 1932, the closest a team got to this 92% rate record were 1961 and 1965 Pel√©'s [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC) with 87%, 1945/1953 [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC), 1939/1951 [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) and 1933/1934/1942/1947 Palmeiras with 88%, and 1946 [S√£o Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_FC) with 90%.

In terms of goals scored, they rank #9 in the history of the tournament, and have the highest record since 1962.

With the departures of [Fl√°vio Concei√ß√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A1vio_Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o), [Rivaldo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaldo) and [M√ºller](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller_%28futebolista%29), Palmeiras had a certain quality drop. Nevertheless, they still finished 2nd to [Cruzeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube) in the *Copa do Brasil* (1-1, 1-2).
 
[Luxemburgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Luxemburgo) left at the end of the season for a bigger salary at [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC). He won 149 of 232 matches (64% win rate), lost 36 matches (16%), and had an overall rate of 71%.

The 1997 season was a bit below due to the lack of titles, but Palmeiras finished 2nd on the league, and reached the semi-finals of the *Copa do Brasil*, of the State League and of the Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament. But it was the arrival of the coach [Scolari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Felipe_Scolari), the *Felip√£o*, in mid-1997 that would ignite Palmeiras into higher flights.

**1998-2000: the** ***Felip√£o*** **(Scolari) Era**

In this period, **Palmeiras won** 2 continental titles (1998 Mercosul, 1999 Libertadores), 2 national cups (1998 *Copa do Brasil*, 2000 *Copa dos Campe√µes*) and 1 regional league (2000 Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament). They also **finished 2nd** in 1 club world cup (1999 Intercontinental Cup), 3 continental cups (1999 and 2000 Copa Mercosul, 2000 Libertadores) and 1 state league (1999 Paulista).

With the 1996-97 team dismantled, Scolari rebuilt the team by using more [Marcos](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Roberto_Silveira_Reis), [Roque J√∫nior](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roque_J%C3%BAnior) and [Galeano](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Aur%C3%A9lio_Galeano), and bringing [Arce](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Arce), [Junior Baiano](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAnior_Baiano), [Os√©as](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os%C3%A9as), [Paulo Nunes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Nunes), [Euller](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euller) and of course, the maestro number 10 [Alex](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexsandro_de_Souza) - the most capped Brazilian player (49) not to be called to a World Cup.

The team lacked the offensive talent and quality of the previous generations, but had a more solid defense. Palmeiras supporters wanted the Copa Libertadores more than anything - their state rivals Santos and S√£o Paulo had two already, as well as Gr√™mio, while Flamengo, Vasco and Cruzeiro had one each. Scolari had the experience of winning the Libertadores in 1995, with Gr√™mio, along with the Paraguayan right-back [Arce](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Arce) and the forward [Paulo Nunes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Nunes) that he brought to Palmeiras.

**The first step** was the [1998 Copa do Brasil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Copa_do_Brasil#Knockout_Stages), which would give one Libertadores spot. Palmeiras didn't have difficulties until the semi-finals against [Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC): they tied 1-1 at home, and Santos opened the score in the return leg. [With these two nice goals](https://youtu.be/Kn7cYmFQmwE?t=122), Palmeiras overcame the score 2-1 and left with a 2-2 tie that put them on the final, against [Cruzeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube). They lost the 1st leg 0-1 away, [and opened the score at '12 with Paulo Nunes in the 2nd leg](https://youtu.be/Kn7cYmFQmwE?t=260). At '89, [Os√©as scored the second and title goal after a free-kick](https://youtu.be/Kn7cYmFQmwE?t=388), as Palmeiras became **Copa do Brasil champions** for the first time.

Later that year, Palmeiras destroyed their [Copa Mercosul group](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Mercosul_de_1998#Grupo_B): 2-1 Independiente (Argentina), 5-0 Nacional (Uruguay), 2-1 U. de Chile (Chile), 3-0 Independiente (Argentina), 3-1 Nacional (Uruguay), 1-0 U. de Chile (Chile). **Highlights** to [this assist by left-back J√∫nior](https://youtu.be/Nssrl8NHXtc?t=172) against Nacional from Uruguay.

With their reserves, they beat [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) 3-1 in Brazil, and tied 1-1 in Argentina, for the quarter-finals. [Olimpia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Olimpia) from Paraguay didn't offer problems in the semis: 2-0 and 1-0 to Palmeiras. **In the final against Cruzeiro**, Palmeiras lost 1-2 away in the 1st leg. At home in the 2nd leg, Cruzeiro opened the score at '3, but [Palmeiras overcame with Cl√©ber at '8, Os√©as at '52 and Paulo Nunes at '85](https://youtu.be/Nssrl8NHXtc?t=481). On the 3rd match, [this goal from Arce](https://youtu.be/Nssrl8NHXtc?t=585) at '62, at home, gave Palmeiras their first continental-second tier title, the [1998 Copa Mercosul](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Mercosul_de_1998#Final).

**The 1999 Copa Libertadores title**

After finishing 2nd twice in their golden era (1961, 1968), Palmeiras finally conquered South America, with 7W-2D-5L. 

Palmeiras shared their group stage with archrival [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) and the Paraguayans [Cerro Porte√±o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Porte%C3%B1o) and [Olimpia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Olimpia). At that time, three teams would advance, and Palmeiras qualified in the 2nd place, behind Corinthians.

**In the ro16**, they met the current champions [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_de_Regatas_Vasco_da_Gama), of [Juninho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho_Pernambucano), [Ram√≥n](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Menezes), [Donizete](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmar_Donizete_C%C3%A2ndido) and [Luiz√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Carlos_Bombonato_Goulart). They only tied 1-1 at home, and saw Vasco open the score at the Maracan√£. Palmeiras scored twice, before conceding the second goal. In the second half, Palmeiras scored twice again, and won the match 4-2.

The derby against [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista) in the quarter-finals saw two same results: 2-0 and 0-2. Their rival could have scored once in the 1st leg though, at '78, [if this crazy shot that hit the upper post and then the back of goalkeeper Marcos had gone a few centimeters into the other side](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=626). In the penalties, Palmeiras won 4-2, with Dinei missing the target and [Marcos saving Vampeta's shot](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=843). 

**In the semis against River Plate**, Palmeiras left Argentina with a 0-1 defeat. At home, in Brazil, [Alex opened the score with this great goal](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=981), and two minutes later, Palmeiras scored the second with [Roque Junior](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=998). In the 2nd half, [Marcos kept the goal safe](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1011), and [Alex closed the Argentine coffin with this fine touch](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1055). 

**In the big final against Deportivo Cali**, they lost the first leg away 0-1 like in the semis. At home, [Palmeiras opened the score only at '65, from this penalty kick](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1194), but [Deportivo tied 5 minutes later, also from a penalty kick](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1223). Five minutes later, however, [Palmeiras scored the second with Os√©as](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1249), and the title would be decided in the penalties. 

**Palmeiras missed the first shot with Zinho**, hitting the upper post, while [Deportivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_Cali) scored. Both teams scored the second and third shots. Palmeiras scored the fourth, and [Deportivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_Cali) hit the right post. [Euller](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euller) scored the fifth, and [Zapata lost Deportivo's final penalty](https://youtu.be/o6K2XarhRv0?t=1496). **Palmeiras conquered South America for the first time in their history**.

This title qualified Palmeiras to the [1999 Intercontinental Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Intercontinental_Cup#Details) in Japan, against European champions [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.). 
 
Palmeiras played a far better match than the Red Devils, but [this unfortunate mistake by goalkeeper Marcos](https://youtu.be/ryMqC824HUU?t=34) let them open the score at '35. Palmeiras also had [this wrongly disallowed goal at '50](https://youtu.be/bErKRmHLJEQ?t=31), and [Os√©as missed this absurd opportunity at '74](https://youtu.be/ryMqC824HUU?t=94). 

**In 2000**, Palmeiras kept the good shape, and began the season winning the Rio-S√£o Paulo Tournament, beating 4-0 the strong [Vasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Vasco_da_Gama) of [Edmundo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmundo_%28futebolista%29) and [Romario](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rom%C3%A1rio) in the final. 

Five months later, they won the *Copa dos Campe√µes*, after beating Cruzeiro (3-1, 1-1), Flamengo (1-2, 1-0) and Sport (2-1), therefore picking a spot in the 2001 Copa Libertadores. 

But the peak of the season was the [Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Copa_Libertadores), which they finished in the 2nd place, losing to [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) in the final (2-2, 0-0), in the penalties (2-4). 

First, *Saint* Marcos (Palmeiras goalkeeper), [saved two penalties in a clutch moment against Pe√±arol in the ro16](https://youtu.be/abHJQqlC4sE?t=189). 

In the semis, **the biggest derby in South American history**: Palmeiras met their archrival [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista), current back-to-back Brazilian League champions, of the stars [Dida](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dida_%28futebolista%29), [Kl√©ber](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_de_Carvalho_Correia), [Vampeta](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampeta), [Ricardinho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Lu%C3%ADs_Pozzi_Rodrigues), [Marcelinho Carioca](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelinho_Carioca), [Edilson](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed%C3%ADlson_da_Silva_Ferreira) and [Luiz√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Carlos_Bombonato_Goulart), once again in the knock-outs, just like in 1999. The first leg [was a crazy 4-3 match in Corinthians' favor](https://youtu.be/OOyq_wqtUtQ?t=76) and the second leg, [another crazy 3-2 match in Palmeiras favor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqJ9L35AW3E). **In the penalties**, nobody had missed their shot, until Corinthians biggest idol, [Marcelinho Carioca](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelinho_Carioca), [had his penalty saved by *Saint* Marcos](https://youtu.be/cqJ9L35AW3E?t=334), who put Palmeiras in the final. **No other derby played in South America** have been higher than Corinthians x Palmeiras encounters in the 1999 and 2000 Copa Libertadores knock-out stages.

**Unfortunately**, the final against Boca Juniors was a refereeing disgrace: Boca had one goal wrongly disallowed and Palmeiras had at least two penalties not awarded in the 2nd leg at home, which ended 0-0, leading to penalties. Palmeiras played better football, while Boca parked the bus.

**2001-2013: end of Parmalat Era, and humble times**

In this period, Palmeiras got relegated twice (2002, 2012), won 1 State League (2008) and 1 *Copa do Brasil* (2012). 

The peak of this period was the **controversial elimination** by [Riquelme's Boca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Rom%C3%A1n_Riquelme) in the 2001 Copa Libertadores semi-finals: on the 1st leg in Argentina (2-2), the referee [invented this penalty to Boca](https://youtu.be/4-PU2BVaAms?t=58), which Schelotto scored, and he didn't concede a clear penalty in Palmeiras' favor on Fernando, sending the player off for ""simulation"". Boca were a great team, but it is generally agreed in Brazil - even by rivals - that Palmeiras was better, and if not for the referees shameful displays in 2000 and 2001, they would very likely end up with 3 consecutive Libertadores titles (1999, 2000, 2001).

In 2002, [Alex](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexsandro_de_Souza) scored [this masterpiece of a goal](https://youtu.be/zPkXzw05P1w?t=199) against [Rog√©rio Ceni's S√£o Paulo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Ceni).

In 2009, Palmeiras led the [Brazilian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Campeonato_Brasileiro_S%C3%A9rie_A#Standings) for 19 rounds, but ended up in the 5th place, not even qualifying to the Copa Libertadores.

**2014-today**

In 2014, centenary year of the club, their new stadium [Allianz Parque](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Imagens_da_Cidade_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_e_Zool%C3%B3gico_da_Capital_Paulista._%2847480340301%29.jpg/1200px-Imagens_da_Cidade_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_e_Zool%C3%B3gico_da_Capital_Paulista._%2847480340301%29.jpg) was inaugurated.

In 2015, Palmeiras won their 3rd *Copa do Brasil* title on the penalties (4-3) against Santos, in a crazy final. The 1st leg in Santos ended 0-1, with their rival [missing the opportunity of the century at '95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTKCbeb_G7s). In the 2nd leg, Palmeiras scored their second goal (2-0) at '84, but [Santos scored at '86](https://youtu.be/I_wsjejQ8QM?t=185), leading it to the penalties, [won 4-3 by Palmeiras](https://youtu.be/I_wsjejQ8QM?t=248).

**In 2016 and 2018**, Palmeiras won their 9th and 10th Brazilian League titles, a national record. They were led by the league MVP [Gabriel Jesus](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Jesus) in 2016 and by the most recent club idol [Dudu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Pereira_Rodrigues) in 2016 and 2018. They also finished second in 2017, and reached the Copa Libertadores semi-finals in 2018, losing to [Boca Juniors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors) (0-2, 2-2).

As of 2020, the club won the State League (0-0, 1-1, p.k. 4-3) after 12 years, against their archrival [Corinthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista), coached by [Luxemburgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderlei_Luxemburgo) and led by the young midfielder [Patrick de Paula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_de_Paula). [Gabriel Menino](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Menino) and [Gabriel Ver√≥n](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Veron) are the other young bets of the club for this season.

To this day, Palmeiras has the 4th largest fanbase in Brazil with 12 million supporters, and a stadium attendance average of 28.000, as of 2019.

[Official] Portsmouth have signed defender Rasmus Nicolaisen on loan from FC Midtjylland,,0.81,18,18,4,soccer
"[Fabrizio Romano] Roma are preparing a new bid to be submitted on next few days to sign Chris Smalling. Talks still on with Manchester United. Solskjaer via @utdreport: ""At the moment, we've not had any bids up to the level that we want. So that's the situation"". üõë @SkySport #MUFC",,0.91,144,144,74,soccer
[Official] Leeds and Sociedad have agreed a deal in principle for the transfer of Diego Llorente,,0.96,252,252,54,soccer
"Idea: Rights holders (Sky, BT, Amazon) should allow clubs to sell tickets to streams of all games during lockdown, with certain conditions (like a 20% tax to be distributed to lower league teams by the FA).","There's a lot of talk about the financial crisis looming in football, as clubs which rely on gate receipts for the majority of their cashflow are suffering in the absence of match-going fans. Big clubs are forgoing millions of pounds of box office revenue, and lower league clubs are suffering too. I had an idea on how to fix it.

**UK Rights holders (Sky, BT Sport, Amazon) should jointly develop a ticketed streaming platform.** Each game week has ten matches, and a streaming ticket to a given match can be bought from either the home or away team.

Each team's ticket allocation is capped at up to 2x their average home attendance in 2019 (or lower if the club doesn't feel it would sell-out a higher capacity).

Ticket prices are capped proportionately by the allocation: the club cannot make more than its average home box office in 2019, so if they 2x their average attendance from 2019 on allocation, they must charge 50% of the ticket price.

75% of the proceeds go directly to the clubs, who are in charge of their own marketing. 20% goes to a fund for lower and non-league clubs (I expect the government would do all sorts of great tax reliefs on this, if it's a way to bail out the sport without them putting their hand in their pocket). 5% is divided amongst rights holders, who are also able to run the same advertising inventory as they do on Sky/BT/Amazon.

Rights holders don't lose advertising eyeballs, generate &gt;¬£1m of income per week (assuming 1.6m total tickets sold) from ticketing, and get a nice PR boost for helping lower and non league clubs.

EPL clubs get a high margin way to reinstate some of their match day income. (They lose 25% to the lower league fund/broadcasters, but presumably on a ¬£4m box office Man Utd pays out some not-insignificant amount to stewards, cleaners, concession workers, etc.) Rather than cannibalising from other outlets, it's possible to envisage a scenario whereby the combination of first-party content from the club and Sky/BT/Amazon broadcast content yields novel ways to make more money (esp. for the majority of EPL clubs who do not have their own TV station).

Lower league clubs get a big cash boost. If 1.6m people watch a game week, it's ¬£6.5m for the lower league fund.

Fans can watch games and feel that they're supporting both their clubs and lower league clubs.",0.58,6,6,8,soccer
"In qualifying for continental competitions this year, the Faroe Islands have had one of the largest jumps in European coefficient by any nation - with more potentially to come. How did they do it, and who will Faroese clubs face in the Europa League third qualifying round?","Football in the Faroe Islands has been quite popular for some time now, including the national team's famous victories against Greece a few years ago. With a population of just 50,000, they've produced a number of excellent footballers - the majority of players called up by the national team are currently playing or have played professional football, and the islands' star player J√≥an S√≠mun Edmundsson helped Arminia Bielefeld to a historic Bundesliga promotion last season. However, Faroese clubs have been far less successful in Europe, usually going out in the first or second qualifying rounds of the Europa League (with V√≠kingur G√∏ta's run to the third qualifying round in 2014-15 being a notable exception).

This year, however, that pattern has begun to change. Perennially languishing near the bottom of the UEFA club coefficient rankings, the Faroes have jumped up four places this year from 53rd of 55 to 49th, an improvement only bettered by Kosovo and Northern Ireland whose populations are tens of times larger. It's taken some brilliant performances, great resolve, and a little bit of luck, but Faroese clubs in 2020 have shown that they're not in qualifying simply to make up the numbers. Here's how each team that made European qualifying has fared:

**4th Place in 2019 (qualified as cup winners): HB**

One of the two largest Faroese clubs based in the capital T√≥rshavn, HB (short for Havnar B√≥ltfelag, or Harbour Football Club in English) had a very disappointing league season in 2019; however, they've improved greatly in 2020, currently standing two points off leaders K√ç with two games in hand. HB looked to have a good chance against Northern Irish side Glentoran in the preliminary round of European qualifying, considering that the Faroese league restarted in on May 9 while the Northern Irish side had little chance to build match fitness. However, this proved not to be the case; HB were toothless in attack and too porous in defence, as Glentoran recorded a 1-0 win and sent the Faroese side out of the Europa League. HB ended as the only Faroese side not to record a single European victory this season.

**3rd place in 2019: NS√ç Runavik**

NS√ç are a perennial threat to the largest clubs in Faroese football but have never quite done enough to win the title. Nevertheless, they have one of the best players in the league and all-time top scorer, one-club man Kl√¶mint Olsen, who has scored more than a goal every other game for them; he also scored a hattrick against Hibernian in a previous Europa League match and even managed an improvised finish from a corner against Spain for the Faroese national team. NS√ç showed Welsh side Barry Town United no mercy in a 5-1 win in the Europa League preliminary round, with Olsen getting another hattrick, but the first qualifying round proved a bridge too far as Aberdeen thrashed them by six goals.

**2nd place in 2019: B36 T√≥rshavn**

B36 outshone their city rivals HB in 2019, finishing in second place, three points off the top. Coached by 40-year-old former Faroese national team stalwart J√°kup √° Borg, they've shown a resiliency and togetherness in Europe that belies their lack of reputation. A preliminary round matchup against St. Joseph's of Gibraltar, whom they beat on penalties at the same stage in 2018-19, was a successful launching point as B36 recorded a 2-1 win. In the first qualifying round, they faced Levadia Tallinn of Estonia, on paper a far superior opponent with a much more valuable squad. Nevertheless, B36's pace and directness caused many problems for Levadia; two second-half goals by Karl Oigus and Trevor Elhi bookended two for B36, both scored by Danish star striker Sebastian Pingel. In the 11th minute of extra time, Fabrice Kouakou of Levadia struck to give his team a 3-2 lead, but two excellent team goals from Ragnar Samuelsen and Hannes Agnarsson saw B36 come away with a 4-3 victory.

In the second qualifying round, B36 faced Welsh runners-up TNS, who came in as favorites having outclassed B36 6-2 on aggregate in 2014-15. However, B36 showed that they were no pushovers in the first half, slicing through the TNS back line on counters, and were unlucky not to go ahead by halftime. In the 47th minute, a brilliant turn and finish by the Pole Michal Przybylski saw B36 take the lead, but TNS were the better side for the rest of the second half, putting tremendous pressure on the B36 defence and eventually equalising in the 80th minute through Leo Smith. TNS added another goal in the 112th minute through Dean Ebbe following an error from B36's young goalkeeper Roi Hentze, but B36 dug deep once again and levelled in the last minute of extra time through a wonderful finish from Faroese U21 international Stefan Radosavljevic. The penalty shootout that followed was equally dramatic; Ebbe had a chance to win the game for TNS from the spot, but Hentze was able to deny him; Pingel then converted the sixth penalty of the shootout, before another Hentze penalty save from Danny Redmond saw B36 record a dramatic win.

In the third round, on Thursday at 19:00 local time/17:00 GMT/12 PM Central Time (US), B36 will face CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria away from home looking to pull off yet another upset. While CSKA haven't been in the best form in their domestic league, they pulled off an impressive 2-0 win against BATE Borisov of Belarus, so it will be another uphill climb for B36 to reach the playoffs. If they manage a win there, B36 will face either Basel or Cypriot side Anorthosis - a very tough draw, but even their performances so far have been nothing short of inspiring.

**Champions in 2019: K√ç**

One of the strongest teams in the Faroes in recent years, K√ç have been putting in decent performances in Europe, beating the likes of Maltese side Birkirkara and Riteriai of Lithuania in the last few seasons. Last year, K√ç pulled off their first league title win in 20 years, and they look primed for another title challenge in 2020.

Their European campaign kicked off in rather odd circumstance - slated to play Slovan Bratislava in the Champions League first qualifying round, they were awarded a 3-0 win after several players and staff from Slovan's team, as well as a few from their replacement squad later on, tested positive for COVID-19; the strict Faroese quarantine laws meant the match could not go ahead. In the second qualifying round, they faced very strong opposition in the shape of Young Boys, but they nevertheless managed to surprise the Swiss champions with their incisive passing and physicality - the best chances in a goalless first half arguably fell K√ç's way. However, Young Boys eventually proved too strong for K√ç and went on to win 3-1.

In the Europa League third qualifying round, at 20:00 local time/18:00 GMT/1 PM Central Time (US), K√ç will face Georgian champions Dinamo Tbilisi, who scraped past Connah's Quay of Wales with a last-minute penalty in normal time. With Sheriff Tiraspol or Dundalk to come in the playoffs should they beat Tbilisi, K√ç have possibly the best chance to reach the Europa League group stage of any Faroese club in history.

I hope you enjoyed this review of Faroese teams' progress in European competitions and the previews of their upcoming Europa League qualifying ties. It will certainly be exciting to watch both matches in two days' time!

AC Milan play Bod√∏/Glimt on Thursday. Don't take them lightly. A quick look at them.,"Bod√∏/Glimt have never won the top flight in Norway, though they've won the cup twice (1975, 1993) and come in 2nd in the top flight 4 times (1977, 1993, 2003, 2019). But this year they are already blowing the rest of the league away. They started the year with 10 straight wins, haven't lost yet, and are scoring 3.6 goals/game while only conceding 1.1. They have a 16 point lead on Molde in 2nd place with 12 games to go. Things could still happen, players could be sold, a bad run of form could hit. But AC Milan would be wise not to look past them in the Europa League.

They've got a fairly balanced attack, with Jens Petter Hauge (20, Norwegian, Midfielder), Phillip Zinckernagel (25, Danish, Midfielder), and Kasper Junker (26, Danish, Forward) all getting between 11 and 14 goals. Their goals allowed stats aren't on any record breaking pace, but they've only allowed 20 this season, which is only 1 worse that the league leaders Rosenborg, so it's also top-notch.

So, more than halfway through the season, let's look at what records they are on pace to break!

Statistic | Current Record | Bod√∏/Glimt today | Projected finish
- | - | - | -
Points | 71 | 50 | 83
Wins (overall) | 22 | 16 | 27
Wins (home) | 14 | 8 | 15
Wins (away) | 10 | 8 | 12
Goal Differential | 67 | 45 | 75
Goals Scored (overall) | 87 | 65 |108
Goals Scored (home) | 43 | 33 | 62
Goals Scored (away) | 44 | 32 | 48


A few other notable things: Only one team has gone an entire season undefeated in the Norwegian top flight before, Rosenborg in 2010. Bod√∏/Glimt still have to play Molde away, and Rosenborg and Vallerenga at home, plus 9 other games. So they're hardly assured of matching that yet. But even with 2 more draws and 2 more losses, they would score 76 points to break the points record. They started the season with 10 wins, which fell 1 short of tying Lillestr√∏m's record from 1986. 

In the EL Qualifying rounds, they've trounced two Lithuanian teams by a combined score of 9-2. So AC Milan will definitely be their most difficult challenge this year, and they've never beaten an Italian side in European competition (Napoli, 76-77; Inter, 78-79; Sampdoria, 94-95), but Milan should be aware that this isn't just any small league team. Bod√∏/Glimt are doing something special, and just might surprise them.
